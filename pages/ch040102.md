# Declaring and Using String Variables

## **21.1 Introduction**
String variables are essential for working with text in QBasic. They allow you to store, manipulate, and display sequences of characters, including letters, numbers, and special characters. In this chapter, we explore how to declare string variables, assign values to them, and use them effectively in your programs.

---

## **21.2 What is a String Variable?**
A **string variable** is a container for storing text-based data. In QBasic:
- String variables are typically named with a `$` at the end of their names (e.g., `name$`).
- They can store any sequence of characters, including spaces and special symbols.
- String variables are declared with the `STRING` data type.

### **Example of a String Variable**
```basic
DIM greeting AS STRING
greeting = "Hello, World!"
```

---

## **21.3 Declaring String Variables**
String variables must be declared before use. This informs QBasic about the variable's data type.

### **Syntax**
```basic
DIM variableName AS STRING
```

### **Examples**
1. Declaring a single string variable:
   ```basic
   DIM name AS STRING
   ```
2. Declaring multiple string variables:
   ```basic
   DIM firstName AS STRING, lastName AS STRING
   ```

3. Using the `$` suffix (optional but common in QBasic):
   ```basic
   DIM name$
   ```

---

## **21.4 Assigning Values to String Variables**
You can assign text to a string variable using the `=` operator. The text must be enclosed in double quotation marks (`"`).

### **Example**
```basic
DIM message AS STRING
message = "Welcome to QBasic!"
PRINT message
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to QBasic!
```

---

## **21.5 Displaying String Variables**
The `PRINT` command is used to display the value of a string variable on the screen.

### **Example**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING
name = "Alice"
PRINT "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Alice!
```

---

## **21.6 User Input with String Variables**
String variables can accept user input using the `INPUT` command.

### **Example: Accepting User Input**
```basic
DIM userName AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your name: ", userName
PRINT "Welcome, "; userName; "!"
```

**Output (if the user enters "John"):**
```
Enter your name: John
Welcome, John!
```

---

## **21.7 Concatenating Strings**
Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together. Use the `+` operator to concatenate strings in QBasic.

### **Example: Concatenating Strings**
```basic
DIM firstName AS STRING
DIM lastName AS STRING
DIM fullName AS STRING

firstName = "John"
lastName = "Doe"
fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

PRINT "Full Name: "; fullName
```

**Output:**
```
Full Name: John Doe
```

---

## **21.8 Modifying String Variables**
You can reassign a new value to a string variable at any time during the program.

### **Example: Modifying a String Variable**
```basic
DIM status AS STRING

status = "Loading..."
PRINT status

status = "Completed!"
PRINT status
```

**Output:**
```
Loading...
Completed!
```

---

## **21.9 Operations on String Variables**

### **21.9.1 Finding the Length of a String**
Use the `LEN` function to determine the number of characters in a string.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Hello, QBasic!"
PRINT "Length of string: "; LEN(text)
```

**Output:**
```
Length of string: 13
```

---

### **21.9.2 Extracting Substrings**
- **`LEFT$`**: Extracts characters from the start of the string.
- **`RIGHT$`**: Extracts characters from the end of the string.
- **`MID$`**: Extracts characters from a specified position.

#### **Examples**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Programming"

PRINT LEFT$(text, 4)    ' Output: Prog
PRINT RIGHT$(text, 4)   ' Output: ming
PRINT MID$(text, 4, 3)  ' Output: gra
```

---

### **21.9.3 Converting Numbers to Strings**
Use the `STR$` function to convert numeric values into strings.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM number AS INTEGER
DIM text AS STRING

number = 100
text = STR$(number)
PRINT "Converted number: "; text
```

**Output:**
```
Converted number:  100
```

---

## **21.10 Common Errors with String Variables**
1. **Missing Quotation Marks:**
   - Strings must be enclosed in double quotes.
   ```basic
   name = Alice   ' Error
   name = "Alice" ' Correct
   ```

2. **Mixing Data Types:**
   - You cannot directly concatenate numbers with strings without converting the numbers to strings.
   ```basic
   PRINT "Age: " + 25  ' Error
   ```

3. **Uninitialized Variables:**
   - Using a string variable without assigning a value can cause unexpected results.

---

## **21.11 Applications of String Variables**

### **21.11.1 Storing User Data**
String variables are ideal for storing names, addresses, and other text data.

#### Example
```basic
DIM name AS STRING
DIM address AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your name: ", name
INPUT "Enter your address: ", address
PRINT "Name: "; name
PRINT "Address: "; address
```

---

### **21.11.2 Creating Dynamic Messages**
String variables allow you to personalize output messages.

#### Example
```basic
DIM userName AS STRING
DIM message AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your name: ", userName
message = "Hello, " + userName + "! Welcome to QBasic."
PRINT message
```

---

### **21.11.3 Processing Multiple Strings**
You can use arrays of string variables to manage lists of text data.

#### Example
```basic
DIM fruits(2) AS STRING
fruits(0) = "Apple"
fruits(1) = "Banana"
fruits(2) = "Cherry"

FOR i = 0 TO 2
    PRINT fruits(i)
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
Apple
Banana
Cherry
```

## **21.12 Best Practices**
1. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Choose meaningful names for string variables to improve readability.
   ```basic
   DIM customerName AS STRING
   ```

2. **Always Initialize Variables:**
   - Assign initial values to string variables to avoid unexpected behavior.
   ```basic
   DIM greeting AS STRING
   greeting = ""
   ```

3. **Validate User Input:**
   - Ensure string inputs meet expected criteria (e.g., non-empty values).
   ```basic
   IF name = "" THEN PRINT "Name cannot be empty."
   ```

4. **Use Concatenation Wisely:**
   - Avoid unnecessary concatenation to simplify your code.

## **21.13 Summary**
String variables are indispensable for handling text in QBasic. By understanding how to declare, assign, and manipulate string variables, you can create flexible and interactive programs. The ability to concatenate strings, extract substrings, and handle user input opens up a wide range of applications for your programs.

In the next chapter, we will explore **advanced string operations**, including searching, replacing, and formatting text.
