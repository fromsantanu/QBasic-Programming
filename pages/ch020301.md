# Numeric and String Data Types

## **9.1 Introduction**
Data types define the kind of data a variable can store, such as numbers or text. In QBasic, the two primary categories of data types are **numeric data types** and **string data types**. Choosing the right data type is essential for efficient program design and execution. This chapter explains the characteristics, usage, and differences between numeric and string data types in QBasic.

## **9.2 Numeric Data Types**
Numeric data types store numbers that can be used for calculations, comparisons, or logical operations. QBasic supports several numeric data types, each designed for specific purposes.

### **9.2.1 Types of Numeric Data**
1. **INTEGER**  
   - Stores whole numbers.  
   - Range: -32,768 to 32,767.  
   - Example: `10`, `-25`.

2. **LONG**  
   - Stores larger whole numbers.  
   - Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.  
   - Example: `100000`, `-999999`.

3. **SINGLE**  
   - Stores floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals).  
   - Range: Approximately -3.4E38 to 3.4E38.  
   - Example: `3.14`, `-0.5`.

4. **DOUBLE**  
   - Stores high-precision floating-point numbers.  
   - Range: Approximately -1.7E308 to 1.7E308.  
   - Example: `3.14159265359`.

### **9.2.2 Declaring Numeric Variables**
Numeric variables are declared using the `DIM` statement, specifying the data type.

```basic
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS SINGLE
```

### **9.2.3 Operations on Numeric Data**
You can perform arithmetic operations on numeric data types, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### **Example: Arithmetic Operations**
```basic
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER

num1 = 15
num2 = 10
sum = num1 + num2

PRINT "The sum is "; sum
```

**Output:**
```
The sum is 25
```

## **9.3 String Data Types**
String data types store sequences of characters, such as words, sentences, or symbols. In QBasic, string variables are identified with a dollar sign (`$`) at the end of their names.

### **9.3.1 Characteristics of String Data**
- Strings can include letters, numbers, spaces, and special characters.
- Strings are enclosed in double quotation marks (`"`).

### **9.3.2 Declaring String Variables**
String variables are declared using the `DIM` statement or directly assigned a value with a `$` suffix.

```basic
DIM name AS STRING
name$ = "Alice"
```

### **9.3.3 String Operations**
Strings can be concatenated, sliced, and compared using various methods.

#### **Concatenation (Joining Strings):**
Use the `+` operator to combine two or more strings.

```basic
DIM firstName AS STRING
DIM lastName AS STRING

firstName = "Alice"
lastName = "Smith"
fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

PRINT "Full Name: "; fullName
```

**Output:**
```
Full Name: Alice Smith
```

#### **Finding Length:**
Use the `LEN` function to find the number of characters in a string.

```basic
DIM name AS STRING
name = "QBasic"
PRINT "Length of name: "; LEN(name)
```

**Output:**
```
Length of name: 6
```

#### **Extracting Substrings:**
Use `LEFT$`, `RIGHT$`, or `MID$` to extract parts of a string.

- **`LEFT$`: Extracts characters from the beginning.**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING
name = "QBasic"
PRINT LEFT$(name, 2)  ' Output: QB
```

- **`RIGHT$`: Extracts characters from the end.**
```basic
PRINT RIGHT$(name, 3)  ' Output: sic
```

- **`MID$`: Extracts characters from a specified position.**
```basic
PRINT MID$(name, 2, 3)  ' Output: Bas
```

## **9.4 Key Differences Between Numeric and String Data**

| **Feature**          | **Numeric Data**                | **String Data**                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Stores numbers for calculations | Stores text or characters             |
| **Data Type Examples**| INTEGER, SINGLE, DOUBLE         | STRING                                |
| **Example Values**    | `10`, `3.14`, `-25`             | `"Hello"`, `"123"`, `"QBasic"`        |
| **Operations**        | Arithmetic operations           | Concatenation, slicing, comparison    |
| **Declaration Syntax**| `DIM num AS INTEGER`            | `DIM name AS STRING` or `name$ = "..."`|

---

## **9.5 Combining Numeric and String Data**
Numeric and string data can be combined in output using the `PRINT` command. Convert numeric data to strings when needed using `STR$()`.

### **Example: Combining Numeric and String Data**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING
DIM age AS INTEGER

name = "Alice"
age = 15

PRINT name + " is " + STR$(age) + " years old."
```

**Output:**
```
Alice is 15 years old.
```

## **9.6 Best Practices**
1. **Choose the Right Data Type:**
   - Use numeric types for calculations and string types for text.
2. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Clearly indicate the purpose of the variable (e.g., `totalMarks` instead of `x`).
3. **Avoid Type Confusion:**
   - Donâ€™t mix numeric and string types without proper conversion.

## **9.7 Summary**
Understanding numeric and string data types is crucial for creating functional and efficient QBasic programs. Numeric data types handle mathematical operations, while string data types deal with text manipulation. By mastering these data types and their operations, you can build versatile and interactive programs.
