# Concatenation of Strings

## **11.1 Introduction**
Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together to form a single string. In QBasic, string concatenation allows you to combine text, variables, and messages dynamically, making your programs more interactive and user-friendly. 

This chapter explains how to perform string concatenation in QBasic, along with examples and best practices.

## **11.2 What is String Concatenation?**
String concatenation is the operation of combining two or more strings using the `+` operator. This is particularly useful when you want to generate dynamic messages or combine multiple inputs.

### **Basic Syntax**
```basic
result = string1 + string2
```

- **string1**: The first string or variable.
- **string2**: The second string or variable.
- **result**: The resulting string after concatenation.

## **11.3 Examples of String Concatenation**

### **11.3.1 Combining Two Strings**
You can directly concatenate two string literals.
```basic
DIM greeting AS STRING

greeting = "Hello, " + "World!"
PRINT greeting
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

---

### **11.3.2 Concatenating String Variables**
You can concatenate variables that hold string values.
```basic
DIM firstName AS STRING
DIM lastName AS STRING
DIM fullName AS STRING

firstName = "John"
lastName = "Doe"
fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

PRINT "Full Name: "; fullName
```

**Output:**
```
Full Name: John Doe
```

---

### **11.3.3 Concatenating Strings and Numbers**
When combining strings and numbers, you must convert the numeric value to a string using the `STR$()` function.

```basic
DIM name AS STRING
DIM age AS INTEGER

name = "Alice"
age = 25

PRINT name + " is " + STR$(age) + " years old."
```

**Output:**
```
Alice is 25 years old.
```

---

## **11.4 Using Concatenation in Dynamic Messages**
String concatenation is often used to generate dynamic and user-specific messages.

### **Example: Personalized Greeting**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your name: ", name
PRINT "Welcome, " + name + "!"
```

**Output (if the user enters "Alice"):**
```
Welcome, Alice!
```

---

## **11.5 Adding Spaces in Concatenated Strings**
You need to explicitly include spaces when concatenating strings. Without them, the strings will appear joined without any separation.

### **Example: Without Spaces**
```basic
DIM city AS STRING
city = "New" + "York"
PRINT city
```

**Output:**
```
NewYork
```

### **Example: With Spaces**
```basic
DIM city AS STRING
city = "New" + " " + "York"
PRINT city
```

**Output:**
```
New York
```

---

## **11.6 Combining Multiple Strings**
You can concatenate multiple strings in a single statement.

### **Example: Multiple Concatenations**
```basic
DIM sentence AS STRING

sentence = "Learning " + "QBasic " + "is " + "fun!"
PRINT sentence
```

**Output:**
```
Learning QBasic is fun!
```

---

## **11.7 Common Mistakes in String Concatenation**

### **11.7.1 Forgetting to Add Spaces**
Omitting spaces between strings results in concatenated output without separation.
```basic
PRINT "Good" + "Morning"
```

**Output:**
```
GoodMorning
```

### **11.7.2 Mixing Data Types Without Conversion**
Attempting to concatenate a string and a number directly without using `STR$()` results in an error.

#### Incorrect:
```basic
PRINT "The value is " + 10  ' Error
```

#### Correct:
```basic
PRINT "The value is " + STR$(10)  ' Correct
```

## **11.8 Best Practices for String Concatenation**
1. **Use Meaningful Variable Names:**
   - Use descriptive names for string variables to make your code easier to understand.
   ```basic
   DIM firstName AS STRING
   DIM lastName AS STRING
   ```

2. **Include Spaces Explicitly:**
   - Always include spaces when concatenating strings to maintain readability.
   ```basic
   PRINT "Hello" + " " + "World"
   ```

3. **Convert Numbers to Strings:**
   - Use `STR$()` to convert numeric values before concatenation.
   ```basic
   PRINT "Age: " + STR$(25)
   ```

4. **Break Long Lines:**
   - For long concatenations, break the line into smaller parts for clarity.
   ```basic
   PRINT "This is the first part of a long sentence " + _
         "and this is the second part."
   ```

## **11.9 Advanced Techniques**
### **11.9.1 Concatenating User Input**
```basic
DIM firstName AS STRING
DIM lastName AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your first name: ", firstName
INPUT "Enter your last name: ", lastName

PRINT "Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName + "!"
```

**Output (if the user enters "John" and "Doe"):**
```
Hello, John Doe!
```

### **11.9.2 Creating Custom Messages**
```basic
DIM product AS STRING
DIM price AS SINGLE

product = "Notebook"
price = 12.99

PRINT "The price of a " + product + " is $" + STR$(price)
```

**Output:**
```
The price of a Notebook is $12.99
```

## **11.10 Summary**
String concatenation is a powerful and versatile tool in QBasic that allows you to combine strings, variables, and messages. By understanding the syntax and practicing with different scenarios, you can enhance the interactivity and readability of your programs.
