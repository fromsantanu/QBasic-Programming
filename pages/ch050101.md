# What is an Array?

## **28.1 Introduction**
An **array** is a data structure used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable. Arrays allow you to manage related data more efficiently by organizing it into a collection that can be accessed and manipulated using indices.

This chapter introduces arrays, their purpose, structure, and basic operations in QBasic.

---

## **28.2 Why Use Arrays?**
When you need to handle multiple related values, such as a list of student grades or names, arrays offer an organized way to group these values under one variable. Instead of creating separate variables for each value, you can use an array to simplify your program.

### **Example Without Arrays**
```basic
DIM grade1 AS INTEGER
DIM grade2 AS INTEGER
DIM grade3 AS INTEGER

grade1 = 85
grade2 = 90
grade3 = 78
```

### **Example With an Array**
```basic
DIM grades(2) AS INTEGER
grades(0) = 85
grades(1) = 90
grades(2) = 78
```

**Advantages of Using Arrays:**
- Easier management of large datasets.
- Simplifies repetitive tasks, such as looping through elements.
- Reduces the number of variables needed.

---

## **28.3 Declaring an Array**
In QBasic, you must declare an array before using it. The declaration specifies the arrayâ€™s name, size, and data type.

### **Syntax**
```basic
DIM arrayName(size) AS dataType
```

- **`arrayName`**: The name of the array.
- **`size`**: The number of elements in the array (starting from 0).
- **`dataType`**: The type of data the array will store (`INTEGER`, `SINGLE`, `STRING`, etc.).

### **Examples**
1. Declaring an array of 5 integers:
   ```basic
   DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
   ```
   *This creates an array `numbers` with 5 elements (indices `0` to `4`).*

2. Declaring an array of 3 strings:
   ```basic
   DIM names(2) AS STRING
   ```

---

## **28.4 Initializing an Array**
Array elements are initialized by assigning values to them individually. Each element is accessed using its index.

### **Example**
```basic
DIM scores(2) AS INTEGER
scores(0) = 85
scores(1) = 90
scores(2) = 78
```

---

## **28.5 Accessing Array Elements**
You can access or modify elements in an array using their indices.

### **Example: Printing Elements**
```basic
DIM scores(2) AS INTEGER
scores(0) = 85
scores(1) = 90
scores(2) = 78

PRINT "First score: "; scores(0)
PRINT "Second score: "; scores(1)
PRINT "Third score: "; scores(2)
```

**Output:**
```
First score: 85
Second score: 90
Third score: 78
```

---

## **28.6 Array Size**
In QBasic:
- The array size determines how many elements the array can hold.
- If an array is declared with size `n`, it can store `n + 1` elements because indices start at `0`.

### **Example**
```basic
DIM numbers(5) AS INTEGER  ' This array holds 6 elements (indices 0 to 5)
```

---

## **28.7 Arrays in Loops**
Arrays are often used with loops to process elements efficiently.

### **Example: Inputting and Printing Array Elements**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "You entered:"
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    PRINT numbers(i)
NEXT i
```

**Input:**
```
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 30
Enter a number: 40
Enter a number: 50
```

**Output:**
```
You entered:
10
20
30
40
50
```

## **28.8 Applications of Arrays**

### **28.8.1 Storing Exam Scores**
```basic
DIM scores(4) AS INTEGER
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter score: ", scores(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "Exam scores are:"
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    PRINT scores(i)
NEXT i
```

---

### **28.8.2 Calculating Average**
```basic
DIM scores(4) AS INTEGER
DIM total AS INTEGER
total = 0

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter score: ", scores(i)
    total = total + scores(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "The average score is "; total / 5
```

---

### **28.8.3 Finding the Maximum Value**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
DIM max AS INTEGER

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
NEXT i

max = numbers(0)
FOR i = 1 TO 4
    IF numbers(i) > max THEN
        max = numbers(i)
    END IF
NEXT i

PRINT "The maximum number is "; max
```

---

## **28.9 Common Errors with Arrays**

1. **Index Out of Bounds:**
   Accessing an index outside the declared size causes an error.
   ```basic
   DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
   PRINT numbers(5)  ' Error: Index out of bounds
   ```

2. **Uninitialized Elements:**
   Using an element without assigning a value may produce unexpected results.
   ```basic
   DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
   PRINT numbers(0)  ' Default value is 0 for numeric arrays
   ```

3. **Misaligned Loop Indices:**
   Ensure loop indices match the array size to avoid errors.
   ```basic
   FOR i = 0 TO 5  ' Error if array size is 4
   ```

---

## **28.10 Best Practices for Using Arrays**

1. **Use Descriptive Names:**
   - Name arrays meaningfully to reflect their purpose.
   ```basic
   DIM studentScores(10) AS INTEGER
   ```

2. **Initialize Arrays:**
   - Always assign values to array elements before using them.

3. **Validate Indices:**
   - Ensure indices are within the valid range to avoid runtime errors.
   ```basic
   IF i >= 0 AND i <= 4 THEN PRINT numbers(i)
   ```

4. **Combine with Loops:**
   - Use loops to simplify repetitive tasks, like inputting or processing elements.

## **28.11 Summary**
An array is a powerful data structure in QBasic that allows you to store and manipulate multiple related values efficiently. By grouping data under a single variable and accessing elements through indices, arrays simplify programming tasks like data storage, calculations, and iterations. Mastering arrays will significantly improve your ability to create dynamic and scalable programs.
