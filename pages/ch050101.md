# What is an Array?

## **19.1 Introduction**
An **array** is a data structure used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable. Instead of creating separate variables for each value, you can use an array to manage a collection of related data efficiently. Arrays are particularly useful when dealing with lists, sequences, or tabular data.

This chapter introduces arrays, their purpose, structure, and basic operations in QBasic.

## **19.2 What is an Array?**
An array is a container that holds multiple values, called **elements**, in a single variable. Each element in the array is identified by its position, known as an **index** or **subscript**. 

### **Key Features of Arrays:**
- All elements in an array share the same data type (e.g., integers, strings).
- Array elements are accessed using their index.
- Indices in QBasic arrays typically start at **0** unless explicitly specified.

### **Example: Comparing Variables and Arrays**
#### Using Separate Variables:
```basic
DIM student1 AS INTEGER
DIM student2 AS INTEGER
DIM student3 AS INTEGER

student1 = 85
student2 = 90
student3 = 78
```

#### Using an Array:
```basic
DIM scores(2) AS INTEGER
scores(0) = 85
scores(1) = 90
scores(2) = 78
```

**Advantages of Using Arrays:**
- Easier to manage and manipulate large datasets.
- Simplifies repetitive tasks, such as calculations or comparisons.

## **19.3 Declaring an Array**
Before using an array in QBasic, you need to declare it. The declaration specifies the array's name, size, and data type.

### **Syntax**
```basic
DIM arrayName(size) AS dataType
```

- **`arrayName`**: The name of the array.
- **`size`**: The number of elements in the array (starting from 0).
- **`dataType`**: The type of data the array will store (e.g., `INTEGER`, `SINGLE`, `STRING`).

### **Example: Declaring an Array**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER  ' Declares an array of 5 integers
```

---

## **19.4 Initializing an Array**
Array elements must be initialized (assigned values) before use. You can initialize an array by assigning values to each element individually.

### **Example: Initializing an Array**
```basic
DIM scores(2) AS INTEGER

scores(0) = 85
scores(1) = 90
scores(2) = 78
```

---

## **19.5 Accessing Array Elements**
Array elements are accessed using their index. The index is written in parentheses after the array name.

### **Example: Accessing and Printing Elements**
```basic
DIM scores(2) AS INTEGER
scores(0) = 85
scores(1) = 90
scores(2) = 78

PRINT "First score: "; scores(0)
PRINT "Second score: "; scores(1)
PRINT "Third score: "; scores(2)
```

**Output:**
```
First score: 85
Second score: 90
Third score: 78
```

---

## **19.6 Array Size**
The size of an array determines the number of elements it can hold. In QBasic:
- An array declared with size `n` can store `n + 1` elements because indices start at `0`.

### **Example: Declaring an Array of Size 5**
```basic
DIM numbers(5) AS INTEGER  ' Holds 6 elements: indices 0 to 5
```

---

## **19.7 Arrays in Loops**
Arrays are often used with loops to perform operations on multiple elements efficiently.

### **Example: Storing and Printing Array Elements Using a Loop**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "You entered:"
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    PRINT numbers(i)
NEXT i
```

**Input:**
```
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 30
Enter a number: 40
Enter a number: 50
```

**Output:**
```
You entered:
10
20
30
40
50
```

## **19.8 Types of Arrays**
### **19.8.1 Single-Dimensional Arrays**
A single-dimensional array stores data in a linear format. It is the most common type of array.

#### Example:
```basic
DIM fruits(3) AS STRING
fruits(0) = "Apple"
fruits(1) = "Banana"
fruits(2) = "Cherry"
fruits(3) = "Date"
```

### **19.8.2 Multi-Dimensional Arrays**
A multi-dimensional array stores data in a tabular format (e.g., rows and columns).

#### Example: 2D Array Declaration
```basic
DIM matrix(2, 2) AS INTEGER  ' A 3x3 matrix
```

---

## **19.9 Common Errors with Arrays**
1. **Out-of-Bounds Index:**
   Accessing an index outside the array's declared size causes an error.
   ```basic
   DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
   PRINT numbers(5)  ' Error: Index out of bounds
   ```

2. **Uninitialized Elements:**
   Using an element without assigning a value can lead to incorrect results.
   ```basic
   DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
   PRINT numbers(0)  ' Default value is 0 for numeric arrays
   ```

---

## **19.10 Applications of Arrays**
### **19.10.1 Storing Exam Scores**
```basic
DIM scores(4) AS INTEGER
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter the score: ", scores(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "Exam Scores:"
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    PRINT scores(i)
NEXT i
```

---

### **19.10.2 Calculating Average**
```basic
DIM scores(4) AS INTEGER
DIM total AS INTEGER
total = 0

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter the score: ", scores(i)
    total = total + scores(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "The average score is "; total / 5
```

---

## **19.11 Best Practices**
1. **Use Meaningful Names:**
   - Name arrays descriptively to reflect their purpose.
   ```basic
   DIM studentScores(10) AS INTEGER
   ```

2. **Initialize Arrays:**
   - Always assign values to array elements before using them.
   ```basic
   DIM prices(4) AS SINGLE
   prices(0) = 10.99
   ```

3. **Validate Indices:**
   - Ensure indices are within bounds to avoid runtime errors.
   ```basic
   IF i >= 0 AND i <= 4 THEN PRINT scores(i)
   ```

4. **Combine Arrays with Loops:**
   - Use loops to simplify repetitive tasks, such as inputting or processing elements.

---

## **19.12 Summary**
An array is a powerful tool for managing collections of data in QBasic. By grouping related values under a single variable and accessing them using indices, arrays simplify coding and enhance efficiency. Understanding single-dimensional arrays, initialization, and loop integration is essential for effectively working with arrays in your programs.
