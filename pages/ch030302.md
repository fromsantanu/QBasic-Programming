# Combining `IF` with Loops

## **18.1 Introduction**
Combining `IF` statements with loops in QBasic allows your program to make decisions during repeated tasks. This combination enables you to evaluate conditions at every iteration of the loop, making your programs more dynamic and interactive.

This chapter explores the synergy between `IF` statements and loops (`FOR...NEXT`, `WHILE...WEND`, and `DO...LOOP`), provides practical examples, and offers tips for effective implementation.

## **18.2 Why Combine `IF` with Loops?**
- **Dynamic Decision-Making:** Check conditions at each iteration of the loop.
- **Filter Data:** Process only specific elements that meet certain criteria.
- **Interrupt or Modify Execution:** Break out of loops or adjust variables based on conditions.

---

## **18.3 Combining `IF` with `FOR...NEXT` Loops**
The `FOR...NEXT` loop executes a block of code a fixed number of times, and you can use `IF` statements within the loop to evaluate conditions.

### **Example: Printing Even Numbers**
```basic
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        PRINT i; " is even."
    END IF
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
2 is even.
4 is even.
6 is even.
8 is even.
10 is even.
```

---

### **Example: Finding the First Number Greater Than a Threshold**
```basic
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    IF i > 5 THEN
        PRINT "The first number greater than 5 is "; i
        EXIT FOR
    END IF
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
The first number greater than 5 is 6
```

---

## **18.4 Combining `IF` with `WHILE...WEND` Loops**
The `WHILE...WEND` loop executes as long as a condition is true. You can use `IF` statements within the loop to add further checks.

### **Example: Summing Positive Numbers**
```basic
DIM num AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER
sum = 0

INPUT "Enter a number (negative to stop): ", num
WHILE num >= 0
    sum = sum + num
    INPUT "Enter another number (negative to stop): ", num
WEND
PRINT "The sum of the positive numbers is "; sum
```

**Output (if user enters `10`, `20`, and `-1`):**
```
Enter a number (negative to stop): 10
Enter another number (negative to stop): 20
Enter another number (negative to stop): -1
The sum of the positive numbers is 30
```

---

### **Example: Skipping Odd Numbers**
```basic
DIM i AS INTEGER
i = 1

WHILE i <= 10
    IF i MOD 2 = 1 THEN
        i = i + 1
        CONTINUE
    END IF
    PRINT i; " is even."
    i = i + 1
WEND
```

**Output:**
```
2 is even.
4 is even.
6 is even.
8 is even.
10 is even.
```

## **18.5 Combining `IF` with `DO...LOOP`**
The `DO...LOOP` provides flexibility in looping with conditions that can be checked either before or after the loop body. Adding `IF` statements allows conditional actions at each iteration.

### **Example: Validating User Input**
```basic
DIM input AS INTEGER

DO
    INPUT "Enter a number between 1 and 10: ", input
    IF input >= 1 AND input <= 10 THEN
        PRINT "You entered a valid number: "; input
    ELSE
        PRINT "Invalid input. Try again."
    END IF
LOOP UNTIL input >= 1 AND input <= 10
```

**Output (if user enters `-5`, `15`, and `8`):**
```
Enter a number between 1 and 10: -5
Invalid input. Try again.
Enter a number between 1 and 10: 15
Invalid input. Try again.
Enter a number between 1 and 10: 8
You entered a valid number: 8
```

---

### **Example: Stopping the Loop Based on a Condition**
```basic
DIM i AS INTEGER
i = 1

DO
    PRINT "Iteration: "; i
    IF i = 5 THEN
        PRINT "Condition met. Stopping the loop."
        EXIT DO
    END IF
    i = i + 1
LOOP WHILE i <= 10
```

**Output:**
```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
Condition met. Stopping the loop.
```

## **18.6 Combining Nested Loops with `IF`**
You can use `IF` statements inside nested loops to handle complex scenarios.

### **Example: Multiplication Table for Even Numbers Only**
```basic
FOR i = 1 TO 5
    FOR j = 1 TO 5
        IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN
            PRINT i; " x "; j; " = "; i * j
        END IF
    NEXT j
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
4 x 1 = 4
4 x 2 = 8
4 x 3 = 12
4 x 4 = 16
4 x 5 = 20
```

## **18.7 Common Errors**
1. **Infinite Loops:**
   - Forgetting to update loop variables inside the `IF` block can cause infinite loops.
   ```basic
   WHILE i <= 10
       IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN
           PRINT i
       END IF
   WEND   ' Missing increment for i
   ```

2. **Misaligned Logic:**
   - Writing conflicting conditions can lead to incorrect results.
   ```basic
   IF i > 5 THEN
       EXIT FOR
   END IF
   PRINT "Value: "; i   ' This will not execute after exit
   ```

3. **Overcomplicating Conditions:**
   - Use logical operators to simplify nested conditions.
   ```basic
   IF a > 0 THEN
       IF b > 0 THEN
   ' Combine as: IF a > 0 AND b > 0 THEN
   ```

---

## **18.8 Best Practices**
1. **Combine `IF` and Loops Effectively:**
   - Use `IF` statements to filter data or manage loop control.
   ```basic
   FOR i = 1 TO 10
       IF i MOD 2 = 0 THEN PRINT i
   NEXT i
   ```

2. **Avoid Nested Loops When Unnecessary:**
   - Simplify logic where possible to maintain readability.

3. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Ensure counters and condition variables have meaningful names.
   ```basic
   FOR studentIndex = 1 TO totalStudents
   ```

4. **Comment Complex Logic:**
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of conditions within loops.

5. **Test Boundary Conditions:**
   - Ensure the loop and `IF` conditions work for edge cases.

## **18.9 Summary**
Combining `IF` statements with loops enables dynamic decision-making during repetitive tasks. Whether using `FOR...NEXT`, `WHILE...WEND`, or `DO...LOOP`, you can evaluate conditions at each iteration to create flexible and efficient programs. By mastering this combination and following best practices, you can build robust applications that handle a variety of scenarios.
