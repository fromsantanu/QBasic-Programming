# DO...LOOP Basics

## **16.1 Introduction**
The `DO...LOOP` construct is one of the most versatile looping mechanisms in QBasic. Unlike `FOR...NEXT` and `WHILE...WEND`, which rely on specific conditions or counters, `DO...LOOP` provides flexibility by allowing conditions to be checked either at the beginning or end of the loop. This chapter introduces the basics of the `DO...LOOP`, its syntax, usage, and practical examples.

---

## **16.2 What is a `DO...LOOP`?**
The `DO...LOOP` executes a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. It is highly versatile because it allows you to decide whether the condition should be checked before entering the loop or after executing the loop body.

---

## **16.3 Types of `DO...LOOP`**
QBasic supports two main forms of `DO...LOOP`:

1. **`DO WHILE`**: Checks the condition before executing the loop body. The loop runs only if the condition is true.
2. **`DO UNTIL`**: Checks the condition before executing the loop body. The loop runs until the condition becomes true.

There is also a variation where the condition is checked after the loop body:
- **`LOOP WHILE`**: Executes the loop body at least once, then checks the condition.
- **`LOOP UNTIL`**: Executes the loop body at least once, then checks the condition.

## **16.4 Syntax of `DO...LOOP`**
### **16.4.1 `DO WHILE`**
```basic
DO WHILE condition
    [statements]
LOOP
```

### **16.4.2 `DO UNTIL`**
```basic
DO UNTIL condition
    [statements]
LOOP
```

### **16.4.3 `DO` with `LOOP WHILE`**
```basic
DO
    [statements]
LOOP WHILE condition
```

### **16.4.4 `DO` with `LOOP UNTIL`**
```basic
DO
    [statements]
LOOP UNTIL condition
```

## **16.5 Examples of `DO...LOOP`**

### **16.5.1 Example: `DO WHILE`**
```basic
DIM count AS INTEGER
count = 1

DO WHILE count <= 5
    PRINT "Count: "; count
    count = count + 1
LOOP
```

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

---

### **16.5.2 Example: `DO UNTIL`**
```basic
DIM number AS INTEGER
number = 0

DO UNTIL number = 5
    PRINT "Number: "; number
    number = number + 1
LOOP
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 0
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
```

---

### **16.5.3 Example: `LOOP WHILE`**
```basic
DIM value AS INTEGER
value = 1

DO
    PRINT "Value: "; value
    value = value + 2
LOOP WHILE value <= 10
```

**Output:**
```
Value: 1
Value: 3
Value: 5
Value: 7
Value: 9
```

---

### **16.5.4 Example: `LOOP UNTIL`**
```basic
DIM total AS INTEGER
total = 0

DO
    total = total + 5
    PRINT "Total: "; total
LOOP UNTIL total >= 20
```

**Output:**
```
Total: 5
Total: 10
Total: 15
Total: 20
```

## **16.6 Differences Between `WHILE`, `UNTIL`, and Variations**

| **Type**          | **Condition Check**  | **Execution** |
|--------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| `DO WHILE`        | Before entering loop | Runs only if condition is true. |
| `DO UNTIL`        | Before entering loop | Runs only if condition is false. |
| `LOOP WHILE`      | After loop body      | Executes at least once, then checks condition. |
| `LOOP UNTIL`      | After loop body      | Executes at least once, then checks condition. |

---

## **16.7 Nested `DO...LOOP`**
You can nest one `DO...LOOP` inside another for complex scenarios.

### **Example: Nested Loops**
```basic
DIM i AS INTEGER
DIM j AS INTEGER

i = 1
DO WHILE i <= 3
    j = 1
    DO WHILE j <= 3
        PRINT "i: "; i; ", j: "; j
        j = j + 1
    LOOP
    i = i + 1
LOOP
```

**Output:**
```
i: 1, j: 1
i: 1, j: 2
i: 1, j: 3
i: 2, j: 1
i: 2, j: 2
i: 2, j: 3
i: 3, j: 1
i: 3, j: 2
i: 3, j: 3
```

---

## **16.8 Breaking Out of a Loop**
You can use the `EXIT DO` statement to terminate a loop prematurely.

### **Example: Using `EXIT DO`**
```basic
DIM i AS INTEGER
i = 1

DO
    PRINT "i: "; i
    IF i = 5 THEN
        PRINT "Exiting the loop."
        EXIT DO
    END IF
    i = i + 1
LOOP WHILE i <= 10
```

**Output:**
```
i: 1
i: 2
i: 3
i: 4
i: 5
Exiting the loop.
```

---

## **16.9 Common Errors with `DO...LOOP`**
1. **Infinite Loop:**
   - Forgetting to update the loop condition can result in an infinite loop.
   ```basic
   DIM count AS INTEGER
   count = 1
   DO WHILE count <= 5
       PRINT count
       ' Missing count = count + 1
   LOOP
   ```

2. **Incorrect Conditions:**
   - Writing contradictory conditions prevents the loop from executing.
   ```basic
   DO WHILE count > 10 AND count < 5
   ```

3. **Uninitialized Variables:**
   - Using uninitialized variables in the condition can lead to unexpected behavior.

---

## **16.10 Applications of `DO...LOOP`**
### **16.10.1 Validating User Input**
```basic
DIM input AS INTEGER

DO
    INPUT "Enter a number between 1 and 10: ", input
LOOP UNTIL input >= 1 AND input <= 10
PRINT "You entered a valid number: "; input
```

---

### **16.10.2 Calculating Sums**
```basic
DIM num AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER

sum = 0
num = 1
DO WHILE num <= 5
    sum = sum + num
    num = num + 1
LOOP
PRINT "The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is: "; sum
```

---

## **16.11 Best Practices for `DO...LOOP`**
1. **Ensure a Proper Exit Condition:**
   - Always update variables to avoid infinite loops.

2. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Choose meaningful names for counters and conditions.
   ```basic
   DIM totalSum AS INTEGER
   ```

3. **Comment Your Code:**
   - Explain the purpose of the loop and its condition.
   ```basic
   ' Repeat until the total reaches 100
   ```

4. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure the loop works as expected for all possible inputs.

---

## **16.12 Summary**
The `DO...LOOP` is a versatile looping construct in QBasic that allows you to execute code repeatedly with flexible condition checks. Whether you use `DO WHILE`, `DO UNTIL`, or their variations, the `DO...LOOP` enables dynamic and interactive program execution. With proper condition handling and best practices, you can use this loop effectively in a wide range of applications.
