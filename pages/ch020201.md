# The `PRINT` Command to Display Messages

## **7.1 Introduction**
The `PRINT` command in QBasic is one of the most commonly used commands for displaying messages, data, and results on the screen. It serves as a vital tool for communication between your program and the user. This chapter explores how to use the `PRINT` command effectively, including syntax, formatting, and advanced techniques.

## **7.2 What is the `PRINT` Command?**
The `PRINT` command outputs text, variables, or calculations on the screen. It is versatile, easy to use, and allows you to format your output in a way that enhances readability.

### **7.2.1 Basic Syntax**
```basic
PRINT [expression]
```

- **expression**: This can be text (string), numbers, variables, or a combination of these.

### **7.2.2 Examples of the `PRINT` Command**
```basic
PRINT "Hello, World!"    ' Displays a simple message
PRINT 25                 ' Displays a number
PRINT 5 + 10             ' Displays the result of a calculation
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
25
15
```

---

## **7.3 Displaying Text Messages**
To display text, enclose it in double quotation marks (`"`). This tells QBasic that the content is a string.

### **Example: Displaying Text**
```basic
PRINT "Welcome to QBasic Programming!"
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to QBasic Programming!
```

---

## **7.4 Displaying Variables and Calculations**
The `PRINT` command can display the values of variables and the results of calculations directly.

### **7.4.1 Example: Displaying Variables**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING
DIM age AS INTEGER

name = "Alice"
age = 12

PRINT "Name: "; name
PRINT "Age: "; age
```

**Output:**
```
Name: Alice
Age: 12
```

### **7.4.2 Example: Displaying Calculations**
```basic
PRINT "Sum of 5 and 10: "; 5 + 10
PRINT "Multiplication of 6 and 7: "; 6 * 7
```

**Output:**
```
Sum of 5 and 10: 15
Multiplication of 6 and 7: 42
```

## **7.5 Formatting Output**
The `PRINT` command provides flexibility in formatting the output, allowing you to control spacing, alignment, and layout.

### **7.5.1 Using Semicolon (`;`)**
The semicolon prevents line breaks and combines multiple items on the same line with no extra spaces.

```basic
PRINT "Hello"; "World"
```

**Output:**
```
HelloWorld
```

### **7.5.2 Using Comma (`,`)**
The comma inserts a tab space between items, aligning them into columns.

```basic
PRINT "Name", "Age"
PRINT "Alice", 12
PRINT "Bob", 14
```

**Output:**
```
Name      Age
Alice     12
Bob       14
```

### **7.5.3 Using the `TAB()` Function**
The `TAB()` function places the output at a specific column position.

```basic
PRINT "Name"; TAB(15); "Age"
PRINT "Alice"; TAB(15); 12
PRINT "Bob"; TAB(15); 14
```

**Output:**
```
Name           Age
Alice          12
Bob            14
```

## **7.6 Using `PRINT` for Decorative Output**
You can use the `PRINT` command creatively to create decorative outputs.

### **Example: Creating Borders**
```basic
PRINT "*********************"
PRINT "* Welcome to QBasic *"
PRINT "*********************"
```

**Output:**
```
*********************
* Welcome to QBasic *
*********************
```

---

## **7.7 Combining Strings and Variables**
The `PRINT` command allows you to combine strings and variables to create dynamic messages.

### **Example: Dynamic Messages**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER
score = 95

PRINT "Your score is "; score; ". Well done!"
```

**Output:**
```
Your score is 95. Well done!
```

---

## **7.8 Advanced Techniques**
### **7.8.1 Using `CHR$()` for Special Characters**
The `CHR$()` function can generate special characters, such as newline (`CHR$(10)`) or tab (`CHR$(9)`).

```basic
PRINT "Line 1" + CHR$(10) + "Line 2"
```

**Output:**
```
Line 1
Line 2
```

### **7.8.2 Printing in a Loop**
You can use `PRINT` in a loop to display patterns or repetitive output.

```basic
FOR i = 1 TO 5
    PRINT "This is line "; i
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3
This is line 4
This is line 5
```

---

## **7.9 Common Errors with the `PRINT` Command**
### **7.9.1 Forgetting Quotation Marks**
If you omit quotation marks when printing text, QBasic will generate an error.
```basic
PRINT Hello  ' Error: QBasic does not recognize Hello as text
```

### **7.9.2 Incorrect Syntax**
If you misuse semicolons, commas, or parentheses, the program might not run as expected.

---

## **7.10 Best Practices for Using `PRINT`**
1. **Use Descriptive Messages:** Clearly describe the output for better readability.
   ```basic
   PRINT "The total cost is: "; totalCost
   ```
2. **Format Output Neatly:** Use `TAB()` or commas to align output for better presentation.
3. **Comment Your Code:** Add comments to explain the purpose of complex `PRINT` statements.

---

## **7.11 Summary**
The `PRINT` command is a versatile and essential tool for displaying messages, variables, and results in QBasic programs. With features like combining strings, formatting output, and using special functions like `TAB()`, the `PRINT` command enables you to create clear, readable, and dynamic outputs.
