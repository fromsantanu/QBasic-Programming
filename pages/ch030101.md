# IF...THEN Statements

## **12.1 Introduction**
The `IF...THEN` statement is a fundamental control structure in QBasic that allows your program to make decisions. It checks a condition and executes a specific block of code only if the condition is true. This enables your program to respond dynamically to different situations, making it more flexible and interactive.

This chapter covers the syntax, usage, and practical examples of `IF...THEN` statements in QBasic.

---

## **12.2 What is an `IF...THEN` Statement?**
The `IF...THEN` statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. If the condition is false, the program skips the block and moves to the next instruction.

### **Syntax**
```basic
IF condition THEN
    [statements]
END IF
```

- **`condition`**: An expression that evaluates to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- **`statements`**: Code executed if the condition is true.

## **12.3 Using `IF...THEN` Statements**
### **12.3.1 Simple `IF...THEN` Example**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age >= 18 THEN
    PRINT "You are eligible to vote."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 20):**
```
You are eligible to vote.
```

**Output (if the user enters 15):**
(No output because the condition is false.)

---

## **12.4 Using `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
When the condition is false, you can use the `ELSE` clause to execute an alternate block of code.

### **Syntax**
```basic
IF condition THEN
    [statements]
ELSE
    [alternate statements]
END IF
```

### **Example**
```basic
DIM temperature AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter the temperature: ", temperature
IF temperature >= 30 THEN
    PRINT "It's a hot day."
ELSE
    PRINT "It's not a hot day."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 35):**
```
It's a hot day.
```

**Output (if the user enters 20):**
```
It's not a hot day.
```

---

## **12.5 Nested `IF...THEN` Statements**
You can use one `IF...THEN` statement inside another to handle more complex conditions.

### **Example: Nested Conditions**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your score: ", score
IF score >= 50 THEN
    IF score >= 90 THEN
        PRINT "Excellent performance!"
    ELSE
        PRINT "Good job!"
    END IF
ELSE
    PRINT "You need to improve."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 95):**
```
Excellent performance!
```

**Output (if the user enters 70):**
```
Good job!
```

**Output (if the user enters 40):**
```
You need to improve.
```

## **12.6 Logical Operators in `IF` Conditions**
QBasic allows you to combine multiple conditions using logical operators.

### **Logical Operators**
| **Operator** | **Description**            | **Example**           |
|--------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| `AND`        | All conditions must be true | `IF a > 10 AND b < 5 THEN` |
| `OR`         | At least one condition must be true | `IF a > 10 OR b < 5 THEN` |
| `NOT`        | Negates the condition       | `IF NOT a = 10 THEN`  |

### **Example: Using `AND`**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age >= 13 AND age <= 19 THEN
    PRINT "You are a teenager."
ELSE
    PRINT "You are not a teenager."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 15):**
```
You are a teenager.
```

**Output (if the user enters 25):**
```
You are not a teenager.
```

---

### **Example: Using `OR`**
```basic
DIM temperature AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter the temperature: ", temperature
IF temperature < 0 OR temperature > 35 THEN
    PRINT "Extreme weather conditions!"
ELSE
    PRINT "Weather is normal."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters -5):**
```
Extreme weather conditions!
```

**Output (if the user enters 20):**
```
Weather is normal.
```

---

### **Example: Using `NOT`**
```basic
DIM raining AS STRING

INPUT "Is it raining? (yes/no): ", raining
IF NOT raining = "yes" THEN
    PRINT "You can go outside."
ELSE
    PRINT "Better stay indoors."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters "no"):**
```
You can go outside.
```

---

## **12.7 Multi-Line `IF...THEN` vs Single-Line `IF...THEN`
You can write simple `IF...THEN` statements in a single line if they require only one statement to execute.

### **Example: Single-Line `IF...THEN`**
```basic
IF age >= 18 THEN PRINT "Eligible to vote."
```

This is equivalent to:
```basic
IF age >= 18 THEN
    PRINT "Eligible to vote."
END IF
```

---

## **12.8 Common Errors with `IF...THEN`**
1. **Syntax Errors:**
   - Missing `THEN` keyword or `END IF` for multi-line statements.
   - Example (Incorrect):
     ```basic
     IF age >= 18
         PRINT "Eligible"
     ```

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - Writing conditions improperly may lead to unexpected results.
   - Example (Incorrect):
     ```basic
     IF age = 18 OR 21 THEN   ' Error: Condition is invalid
     ```

3. **Unmatched Data Types:**
   - Comparing numeric variables with string values can cause errors.
   - Example (Incorrect):
     ```basic
     IF age = "eighteen" THEN  ' Error
     ```

---

## **12.9 Best Practices for `IF...THEN`**
1. **Use Indentation for Readability:**
   - Indent the code inside `IF` blocks to improve readability.
   ```basic
   IF condition THEN
       PRINT "Condition met"
   END IF
   ```

2. **Combine Conditions Wisely:**
   - Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to simplify complex conditions.

3. **Comment Your Code:**
   - Add comments to explain the logic of conditions.
   ```basic
   IF age >= 18 THEN   ' Check if the user is an adult
   ```

4. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Test conditions thoroughly to ensure all scenarios are handled correctly.

---

## **12.10 Summary**
The `IF...THEN` statement is a powerful control structure that allows programs to make decisions based on conditions. By mastering `IF...THEN`, `IF...THEN...ELSE`, nested conditions, and logical operators, you can create dynamic programs that respond to various scenarios.
