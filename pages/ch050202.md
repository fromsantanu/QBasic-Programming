# Simple Array Operations

## **31.1 Introduction**
Arrays are essential in programming for storing and managing multiple related values. To fully utilize arrays, you need to understand basic operations such as initialization, traversal, updating, and performing calculations on array elements. In this chapter, we will explore simple array operations in QBasic and provide examples to solidify your understanding.

## **31.2 Overview of Array Operations**
Basic operations you can perform on arrays include:
1. **Initialization**: Assigning values to elements in the array.
2. **Traversal**: Accessing each element in the array.
3. **Updating**: Changing the value of specific elements.
4. **Summation**: Calculating the total of all elements.
5. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values**: Identifying the largest or smallest value in the array.
6. **Searching**: Checking if a specific value exists in the array.

## **31.3 Initializing Arrays**

### **31.3.1 Manual Initialization**
Assign values to each array element individually.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM numbers(2) AS INTEGER
numbers(0) = 5
numbers(1) = 10
numbers(2) = 15

PRINT numbers(0), numbers(1), numbers(2)
```

**Output:**
```
5  10  15
```

---

### **31.3.2 Initialization Using Loops**
Use a loop to initialize all elements.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    numbers(i) = i * 2
NEXT i

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    PRINT "numbers("; i; ") = "; numbers(i)
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
numbers(0) = 0
numbers(1) = 2
numbers(2) = 4
numbers(3) = 6
numbers(4) = 8
```

---

## **31.4 Traversing Arrays**
Access and print each element in the array using a loop.

### **Example**
```basic
DIM names(2) AS STRING

names(0) = "Alice"
names(1) = "Bob"
names(2) = "Charlie"

FOR i = 0 TO 2
    PRINT "Name "; i + 1; ": "; names(i)
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
Name 1: Alice
Name 2: Bob
Name 3: Charlie
```

---

## **31.5 Updating Array Elements**
Modify the value of specific elements in an array.

### **Example**
```basic
DIM scores(2) AS INTEGER

scores(0) = 85
scores(1) = 90
scores(2) = 78

PRINT "Original score: "; scores(1)

scores(1) = 95  ' Update the second element
PRINT "Updated score: "; scores(1)
```

**Output:**
```
Original score: 90
Updated score: 95
```

---

## **31.6 Calculating the Sum of Elements**
Add all elements in an array to calculate their sum.

### **Example**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
DIM total AS INTEGER
total = 0

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
    total = total + numbers(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "The total sum is: "; total
```

**Input:**
```
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 15
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 25
```

**Output:**
```
The total sum is: 75
```

---

## **31.7 Finding the Maximum and Minimum Values**
Identify the largest or smallest value in the array.

### **Finding the Maximum**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
DIM max AS INTEGER

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
NEXT i

max = numbers(0)
FOR i = 1 TO 4
    IF numbers(i) > max THEN
        max = numbers(i)
    END IF
NEXT i

PRINT "The maximum number is: "; max
```

**Input:**
```
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 15
Enter a number: 25
Enter a number: 5
```

**Output:**
```
The maximum number is: 25
```

---

### **Finding the Minimum**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
DIM min AS INTEGER

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
NEXT i

min = numbers(0)
FOR i = 1 TO 4
    IF numbers(i) < min THEN
        min = numbers(i)
    END IF
NEXT i

PRINT "The minimum number is: "; min
```

---

## **31.8 Searching for an Element**
Determine whether a specific value exists in the array.

### **Example**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
DIM search AS INTEGER
DIM found AS INTEGER

found = 0

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
NEXT i

INPUT "Enter a number to search for: ", search
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    IF numbers(i) = search THEN
        PRINT search; " found at position "; i
        found = 1
        EXIT FOR
    END IF
NEXT i

IF found = 0 THEN
    PRINT search; " not found."
END IF
```

**Input:**
```
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 30
Enter a number: 40
Enter a number: 50
Enter a number to search for: 30
```

**Output:**
```
30 found at position 2
```

## **31.9 Best Practices for Simple Array Operations**

1. **Initialize Arrays Properly:**
   - Assign default values to array elements before using them.

2. **Validate Index Access:**
   - Ensure the index is within the array's bounds.
   ```basic
   IF i >= 0 AND i <= UBOUND(numbers) THEN ...
   ```

3. **Use Loops Efficiently:**
   - Use loops to traverse and process arrays instead of repeating code.

4. **Use Meaningful Variable Names:**
   - Name arrays and indices descriptively for better readability.
   ```basic
   DIM studentScores(10) AS INTEGER
   ```

## **31.10 Summary**
Understanding simple array operations is essential for working with collections of data in QBasic. This chapter covered how to initialize arrays, traverse elements, update values, and perform calculations such as summation, finding maximum/minimum values, and searching for specific elements. These operations form the foundation for more advanced array manipulation techniques.
