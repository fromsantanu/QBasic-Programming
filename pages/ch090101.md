# Creating a Calculator

## **43.1 Introduction**
A calculator is one of the simplest yet most useful programs you can create to practice programming. In this chapter, we will build a basic calculator in QBasic that allows users to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program will take user inputs, process the operation, and display the result.

## **43.2 Features of the Calculator**
1. **User-Friendly Interface**: The program will display options for different arithmetic operations.
2. **Input Validation**: Ensures valid inputs for numbers and operations.
3. **Basic Operations**:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division (with handling for division by zero)
4. **Option to Exit**: Allows the user to exit the program.

## **43.3 Designing the Calculator**

The calculator will use:
- **`INPUT`**: To take user input for numbers and operations.
- **`SELECT CASE`**: To perform the chosen operation.
- **Loops**: To allow repeated use without restarting the program.

## **43.4 Calculator Code**

### **Program Code**
```basic
SCREEN 12

DO
    ' Display the menu
    PRINT "Simple Calculator"
    PRINT "------------------"
    PRINT "1. Addition (+)"
    PRINT "2. Subtraction (-)"
    PRINT "3. Multiplication (*)"
    PRINT "4. Division (/)"
    PRINT "5. Exit"
    INPUT "Choose an operation (1-5): ", choice

    ' Exit the program if the user chooses 5
    IF choice = 5 THEN
        PRINT "Exiting the calculator. Goodbye!"
        EXIT DO
    END IF

    ' Take inputs for the two numbers
    INPUT "Enter the first number: ", num1
    INPUT "Enter the second number: ", num2

    ' Perform the selected operation
    SELECT CASE choice
        CASE 1
            result = num1 + num2
            PRINT "Result: "; num1; " + "; num2; " = "; result
        CASE 2
            result = num1 - num2
            PRINT "Result: "; num1; " - "; num2; " = "; result
        CASE 3
            result = num1 * num2
            PRINT "Result: "; num1; " * "; num2; " = "; result
        CASE 4
            IF num2 <> 0 THEN
                result = num1 / num2
                PRINT "Result: "; num1; " / "; num2; " = "; result
            ELSE
                PRINT "Error: Division by zero is not allowed!"
            END IF
        CASE ELSE
            PRINT "Invalid choice! Please select a valid operation."
    END SELECT

    PRINT
    INPUT "Press Enter to continue..."
    CLS  ' Clear the screen for the next operation
LOOP
```

## **43.5 Explanation of the Code**

### **Menu Display**
The program starts by displaying a menu with five options:
1. **Addition**
2. **Subtraction**
3. **Multiplication**
4. **Division**
5. **Exit**

### **Taking User Input**
- The `INPUT` statement is used to take the user’s choice and the two numbers for calculation.

### **Performing Operations**
- The `SELECT CASE` statement executes the operation corresponding to the user’s choice.
- For division, an `IF` condition checks for division by zero.

### **Loop for Repeated Use**
- The program uses a `DO...LOOP` to allow users to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

## **43.6 Sample Interaction**

### **Input**
```
Simple Calculator
------------------
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exit
Choose an operation (1-5): 1
Enter the first number: 12
Enter the second number: 8
```

### **Output**
```
Result: 12 + 8 = 20
Press Enter to continue...
```

---

### **Handling Division by Zero**
#### **Input**
```
Choose an operation (1-5): 4
Enter the first number: 15
Enter the second number: 0
```

#### **Output**
```
Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
Press Enter to continue...
```

## **43.7 Extending the Calculator**

### **Adding More Operations**
You can extend the calculator to include additional operations such as:
1. **Square Root**:
   ```basic
   CASE 6
       IF num1 >= 0 THEN
           result = SQR(num1)
           PRINT "Result: Square root of "; num1; " = "; result
       ELSE
           PRINT "Error: Square root of a negative number is not defined!"
       END IF
   ```
2. **Exponentiation**:
   ```basic
   CASE 7
       result = num1 ^ num2
       PRINT "Result: "; num1; " ^ "; num2; " = "; result
   ```

---

## **43.8 Common Issues and Solutions**

1. **Invalid Input for Numbers:**
   - Add validation to ensure the user enters valid numeric data.

2. **Invalid Operation Choice:**
   - Handle invalid menu choices with a default case in the `SELECT CASE` statement.

3. **Division by Zero:**
   - Always check if the divisor is zero before performing division.

---

## **43.9 Best Practices**

1. **User Feedback:**
   - Provide clear instructions and error messages.

2. **Modular Design:**
   - Use subroutines for each operation to improve readability and maintainability.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Ensure all user inputs are valid to prevent runtime errors.

4. **Use Loops Wisely:**
   - Allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

## **43.10 Summary**
A calculator program is a great way to practice basic programming concepts like input handling, conditional statements, loops, and arithmetic operations. By building a user-friendly menu and handling potential errors like division by zero, you can create a functional and robust calculator. With slight modifications, this program can be extended to perform more advanced mathematical operations.
