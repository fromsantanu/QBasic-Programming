# Storing Multiple Values

## **30.1 Introduction**
Programming often involves managing multiple related pieces of data, such as a list of student grades, product prices, or names. Efficiently storing and processing this data is crucial for creating organized and scalable programs. In QBasic, arrays are the primary tool for storing multiple values in a structured and manageable way.

This chapter explores how to store, organize, and manipulate multiple values using arrays and other techniques in QBasic.

## **30.2 Why Store Multiple Values?**
When working with multiple data points, creating separate variables for each value can quickly become impractical. Arrays and other structures allow you to:
- Group related data under a single variable name.
- Access individual elements using indices.
- Perform operations on all elements using loops.

---

## **30.3 Methods to Store Multiple Values**

### **30.3.1 Using Separate Variables**
You can use individual variables to store values, but this approach becomes inefficient as the number of values increases.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM grade1 AS INTEGER
DIM grade2 AS INTEGER
DIM grade3 AS INTEGER

grade1 = 85
grade2 = 90
grade3 = 78

PRINT grade1, grade2, grade3
```

---

### **30.3.2 Using Arrays**
Arrays are the preferred method for storing multiple values of the same type.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM grades(2) AS INTEGER

grades(0) = 85
grades(1) = 90
grades(2) = 78

FOR i = 0 TO 2
    PRINT grades(i)
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
85
90
78
```

---

## **30.4 Declaring Arrays for Multiple Values**
Arrays must be declared with a name, size, and data type. This allows you to store multiple values efficiently.

### **Syntax**
```basic
DIM arrayName(size) AS dataType
```

- **`arrayName`**: The name of the array.
- **`size`**: The number of elements in the array (starting from 0).
- **`dataType`**: The type of data the array will hold (`INTEGER`, `SINGLE`, `STRING`, etc.).

---

### **Examples**
1. Declaring an array of integers to store scores:
   ```basic
   DIM scores(4) AS INTEGER
   ```

2. Declaring an array of strings to store names:
   ```basic
   DIM names(2) AS STRING
   ```

3. Declaring an array of decimal numbers to store prices:
   ```basic
   DIM prices(9) AS SINGLE
   ```

---

## **30.5 Storing Values in Arrays**

### **Example: Initializing Array Values**
```basic
DIM numbers(3) AS INTEGER

numbers(0) = 10
numbers(1) = 20
numbers(2) = 30
numbers(3) = 40

FOR i = 0 TO 3
    PRINT "Element "; i; ": "; numbers(i)
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
Element 0: 10
Element 1: 20
Element 2: 30
Element 3: 40
```

---

## **30.6 Accessing and Modifying Values**

### **Example: Accessing Array Elements**
```basic
DIM names(2) AS STRING

names(0) = "Alice"
names(1) = "Bob"
names(2) = "Charlie"

PRINT "First Name: "; names(0)
PRINT "Last Name: "; names(2)
```

**Output:**
```
First Name: Alice
Last Name: Charlie
```

---

### **Example: Modifying Array Elements**
```basic
DIM numbers(2) AS INTEGER

numbers(0) = 10
numbers(1) = 20
numbers(2) = 30

PRINT "Before update: "; numbers(1)

numbers(1) = 25  ' Update the second element
PRINT "After update: "; numbers(1)
```

**Output:**
```
Before update: 20
After update: 25
```

---

## **30.7 Using Loops with Arrays**
Loops make it easy to initialize, access, and process multiple values in an array.

### **Example: Inputting and Printing Values**
```basic
DIM scores(4) AS INTEGER

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a score: ", scores(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "You entered the following scores:"
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    PRINT scores(i)
NEXT i
```

**Input:**
```
Enter a score: 85
Enter a score: 90
Enter a score: 78
Enter a score: 92
Enter a score: 88
```

**Output:**
```
You entered the following scores:
85
90
78
92
88
```

---

## **30.8 Practical Applications of Storing Multiple Values**

### **30.8.1 Storing Exam Grades**
Store and calculate the average of student grades.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM grades(4) AS INTEGER
DIM total AS INTEGER
total = 0

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter grade: ", grades(i)
    total = total + grades(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "The average grade is: "; total / 5
```

---

### **30.8.2 Storing Product Prices**
Store and display a list of product prices.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM prices(2) AS SINGLE

prices(0) = 9.99
prices(1) = 14.99
prices(2) = 19.99

PRINT "Product Prices:"
FOR i = 0 TO 2
    PRINT "$"; prices(i)
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
Product Prices:
$9.99
$14.99
$19.99
```

---

### **30.8.3 Storing and Searching Data**
Use arrays to store data and search for specific values.

#### **Example: Searching for a Name**
```basic
DIM names(4) AS STRING
DIM found AS INTEGER
found = 0

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a name: ", names(i)
NEXT i

INPUT "Enter a name to search for: ", searchName
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    IF names(i) = searchName THEN
        PRINT searchName; " found at position "; i
        found = 1
        EXIT FOR
    END IF
NEXT i

IF found = 0 THEN
    PRINT searchName; " not found."
END IF
```

---

## **30.9 Best Practices**

1. **Use Arrays for Related Data:**
   - Group related values into an array to reduce the number of variables.

2. **Use Descriptive Names:**
   - Name arrays based on their purpose.
   ```basic
   DIM studentGrades(10) AS INTEGER
   ```

3. **Initialize Arrays:**
   - Assign initial values to array elements before using them.

4. **Validate Input:**
   - Ensure that input matches the expected data type and range.

5. **Comment Code:**
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of arrays and loops.
   ```basic
   ' Store and process scores in an array
   ```

---

## **30.10 Summary**
Storing multiple values in QBasic is straightforward using arrays. Arrays allow you to organize data into collections that are easy to manage and process. By leveraging loops and array functions, you can perform dynamic operations like input validation, searching, and calculations. Mastering arrays will significantly enhance your programming capabilities, enabling you to handle complex datasets effectively.
