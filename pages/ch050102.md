# Declaring and Accessing Arrays

## **29.1 Introduction**
Arrays are a vital part of programming, allowing you to store and manage collections of related data. In QBasic, arrays are declared with a specific size and data type, and their elements are accessed using indices. This chapter will guide you through the process of declaring arrays, initializing them, and accessing their elements.

---

## **29.2 Declaring an Array**
Before using an array, you must declare it. Declaration specifies the array's name, size, and the type of data it will store.

### **29.2.1 Syntax**
```basic
DIM arrayName(size) AS dataType
```

- **`arrayName`**: The name of the array.
- **`size`**: The number of elements in the array (starting from 0).
- **`dataType`**: The type of data the array will hold (`INTEGER`, `SINGLE`, `STRING`, etc.).

---

### **29.2.2 Examples**
1. Declaring an array of integers with 5 elements:
   ```basic
   DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
   ```
   *This creates an array named `numbers` with 5 elements (indices `0` to `4`).*

2. Declaring an array of strings to store names:
   ```basic
   DIM names(2) AS STRING
   ```
   *This creates an array named `names` with 3 elements (indices `0` to `2`).*

3. Declaring an array of decimal numbers:
   ```basic
   DIM prices(9) AS SINGLE
   ```
   *This creates an array `prices` with 10 elements (indices `0` to `9`).*

---

## **29.3 Initializing an Array**
After declaring an array, you can assign values to its elements individually. Each element is accessed using its index.

### **Example: Initializing an Array**
```basic
DIM scores(2) AS INTEGER

scores(0) = 85
scores(1) = 90
scores(2) = 78
```

---

## **29.4 Accessing Array Elements**
Array elements are accessed using their indices. Indices start at `0` and go up to the declared size of the array minus one.

### **Syntax**
```basic
element = arrayName(index)
```

- **`arrayName`**: The name of the array.
- **`index`**: The position of the element to access.

---

### **Example: Accessing Elements**
```basic
DIM scores(2) AS INTEGER

scores(0) = 85
scores(1) = 90
scores(2) = 78

PRINT "First score: "; scores(0)
PRINT "Second score: "; scores(1)
PRINT "Third score: "; scores(2)
```

**Output:**
```
First score: 85
Second score: 90
Third score: 78
```

---

### **Modifying Elements**
You can update the value of an array element by reassigning it.

#### **Example: Updating Array Values**
```basic
DIM numbers(2) AS INTEGER

numbers(0) = 5
numbers(1) = 10
numbers(2) = 15

PRINT "Before update: "; numbers(1)

numbers(1) = 20  ' Update the second element
PRINT "After update: "; numbers(1)
```

**Output:**
```
Before update: 10
After update: 20
```

---

## **29.5 Accessing Arrays in Loops**
Loops are a convenient way to access and process array elements.

### **Example: Inputting and Printing Array Elements**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "You entered:"
FOR i = 0 TO 4
    PRINT numbers(i)
NEXT i
```

**Input:**
```
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 30
Enter a number: 40
Enter a number: 50
```

**Output:**
```
You entered:
10
20
30
40
50
```

---

## **29.6 Practical Applications of Declaring and Accessing Arrays**

### **29.6.1 Storing User Input**
Arrays can store multiple pieces of user input.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM names(2) AS STRING

FOR i = 0 TO 2
    INPUT "Enter a name: ", names(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "The names entered are:"
FOR i = 0 TO 2
    PRINT names(i)
NEXT i
```

---

### **29.6.2 Calculating the Sum of Numbers**
#### **Example**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
DIM total AS INTEGER
total = 0

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
    total = total + numbers(i)
NEXT i

PRINT "The total sum is: "; total
```

---

### **29.6.3 Finding the Maximum Value**
#### **Example**
```basic
DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
DIM max AS INTEGER

FOR i = 0 TO 4
    INPUT "Enter a number: ", numbers(i)
NEXT i

max = numbers(0)
FOR i = 1 TO 4
    IF numbers(i) > max THEN
        max = numbers(i)
    END IF
NEXT i

PRINT "The maximum number is: "; max
```

---

## **29.7 Common Errors with Arrays**

1. **Index Out of Bounds:**
   Accessing an index outside the declared size causes an error.
   ```basic
   DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
   PRINT numbers(5)  ' Error: Index out of bounds
   ```

2. **Uninitialized Elements:**
   Using elements without assigning values may produce unexpected results.
   ```basic
   DIM numbers(4) AS INTEGER
   PRINT numbers(0)  ' Default value is 0 for numeric arrays
   ```

3. **Misaligned Loop Indices:**
   Ensure loop indices match the array size to avoid errors.
   ```basic
   FOR i = 0 TO 5  ' Error if array size is 4
   ```

---

## **29.8 Best Practices**

1. **Use Descriptive Names:**
   - Name arrays based on their purpose to make code more readable.
   ```basic
   DIM studentScores(10) AS INTEGER
   ```

2. **Initialize Arrays:**
   - Always assign values to elements before using them.
   ```basic
   DIM prices(4) AS SINGLE
   prices(0) = 12.5
   ```

3. **Validate Indices:**
   - Ensure indices are within bounds to avoid runtime errors.
   ```basic
   IF i >= 0 AND i <= 4 THEN PRINT numbers(i)
   ```

4. **Combine with Loops:**
   - Use loops to simplify repetitive tasks like inputting or processing elements.

5. **Comment Your Code:**
   - Add comments to clarify the purpose of arrays and loops.
   ```basic
   ' Store exam scores in an array
   ```

## **29.9 Summary**
Declaring and accessing arrays in QBasic is straightforward and provides an efficient way to handle collections of related data. By understanding how to initialize, access, and modify arrays, you can build programs that are both dynamic and scalable. Arrays, when combined with loops, offer a powerful toolset for processing data efficiently.
