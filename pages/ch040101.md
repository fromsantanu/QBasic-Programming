# What is a String?

## **20.1 Introduction**
In programming, a **string** is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings can include letters, numbers, spaces, and special characters, making them one of the most versatile data types in QBasic. Whether you're displaying messages, accepting user input, or processing text, strings are an essential tool in any program.

This chapter explores the basics of strings, their declaration, manipulation, and practical applications in QBasic.

## **20.2 What is a String?**
A string is a collection of characters enclosed in double quotation marks (`"`). It can include:
- Letters: `A-Z` or `a-z`
- Digits: `0-9`
- Special characters: `! @ # $ % ^ & * ( )` etc.
- Spaces

### **Examples of Strings**
```basic
"Hello, World!"     ' A greeting message
"12345"             ' A numeric string
"$99.99"            ' A price as a string
" "                 ' A string with a single space
"QBasic Programming" ' A text string
```

---

## **20.3 Declaring a String Variable**
In QBasic, string variables must be declared as `STRING`. By convention, string variables often include a `$` symbol at the end of their names, although this is optional.

### **Syntax**
```basic
DIM variableName AS STRING
```

### **Examples**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING
name$ = "Alice"
```

---

## **20.4 Assigning Values to Strings**
String values are assigned using the `=` operator, with the text enclosed in double quotation marks.

### **Example: Assigning Strings**
```basic
DIM message AS STRING
message = "Welcome to QBasic!"
PRINT message
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to QBasic!
```

---

## **20.5 String Operations**
Strings in QBasic can be manipulated in various ways, such as concatenation, slicing, and using built-in functions.

---

### **20.5.1 Concatenation**
Concatenation combines two or more strings into one. Use the `+` operator for this.

#### **Example: Combining Strings**
```basic
DIM firstName AS STRING
DIM lastName AS STRING
DIM fullName AS STRING

firstName = "John"
lastName = "Doe"
fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

PRINT "Full Name: "; fullName
```

**Output:**
```
Full Name: John Doe
```

---

### **20.5.2 Finding String Length**
Use the `LEN` function to determine the number of characters in a string, including spaces and special characters.

#### **Example: String Length**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Hello, World!"
PRINT "Length of string: "; LEN(text)
```

**Output:**
```
Length of string: 13
```

---

### **20.5.3 Extracting Substrings**
QBasic provides functions to extract parts of a string:
- **`LEFT$`**: Extracts characters from the beginning.
- **`RIGHT$`**: Extracts characters from the end.
- **`MID$`**: Extracts characters from a specific position.

#### **Examples: Substring Operations**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Programming"

PRINT LEFT$(text, 4)    ' Output: Prog
PRINT RIGHT$(text, 5)   ' Output: mming
PRINT MID$(text, 4, 3)  ' Output: gra
```

---

### **20.5.4 Converting Numbers to Strings**
Use the `STR$` function to convert numeric values into strings.

#### **Example: Numeric to String Conversion**
```basic
DIM number AS INTEGER
DIM text AS STRING

number = 123
text = STR$(number)
PRINT "The number as a string: "; text
```

**Output:**
```
The number as a string:  123
```

---

### **20.5.5 Combining Strings and Numbers**
When combining strings and numbers, you must first convert the number into a string using `STR$`.

#### **Example: Combining Strings and Numbers**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING
DIM age AS INTEGER

name = "Alice"
age = 25

PRINT name + " is " + STR$(age) + " years old."
```

**Output:**
```
Alice is 25 years old.
```

---

## **20.6 Inputting Strings**
Use the `INPUT` command to accept string input from the user.

### **Example: User Input**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your name: ", name
PRINT "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

**Output (if user enters "John"):**
```
Enter your name: John
Hello, John!
```

---

## **20.7 Common Errors with Strings**
1. **Forgetting Quotation Marks:**
   - Strings must be enclosed in double quotes.
   ```basic
   name = Alice   ' Error
   name = "Alice" ' Correct
   ```

2. **Mixing Data Types:**
   - Numbers cannot be concatenated with strings without conversion.
   ```basic
   PRINT "Age: " + 25  ' Error
   ```

3. **Accessing Invalid Indices:**
   - Functions like `MID$` may throw errors if indices exceed the string length.

---

## **20.8 Applications of Strings**
### **20.8.1 Creating Dynamic Messages**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your name: ", name
PRINT "Welcome, " + name + ", to the QBasic tutorial!"
```

---

### **20.8.2 Validating User Input**
```basic
DIM answer AS STRING

INPUT "Do you want to continue? (yes/no): ", answer
IF answer = "yes" THEN
    PRINT "Continuing the program..."
ELSE
    PRINT "Program terminated."
END IF
```

---

### **20.8.3 Storing and Displaying Text Data**
```basic
DIM fruits(2) AS STRING
fruits(0) = "Apple"
fruits(1) = "Banana"
fruits(2) = "Cherry"

FOR i = 0 TO 2
    PRINT fruits(i)
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
Apple
Banana
Cherry
```

---

## **20.9 Best Practices**
1. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Name your string variables meaningfully.
   ```basic
   DIM userName AS STRING
   ```

2. **Avoid Redundant Concatenation:**
   - Concatenate only when necessary to improve performance and readability.

3. **Validate String Inputs:**
   - Ensure user input meets expected criteria (e.g., non-empty strings).
   ```basic
   IF name = "" THEN
       PRINT "Name cannot be empty."
   END IF
   ```

4. **Format Strings Clearly:**
   - Use spaces and separators for better readability.
   ```basic
   PRINT "Item: " + itemName + ", Price: $" + STR$(price)
   ```

## **20.10 Summary**
Strings are a vital part of programming, enabling text representation, manipulation, and user interaction. By mastering operations like concatenation, substring extraction, and combining strings with numbers, you can create flexible and user-friendly programs. Understanding how to declare, initialize, and manipulate strings will significantly enhance your programming skills.
