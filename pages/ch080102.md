# Drawing Shapes and Patterns

## **40.1 Introduction**
Drawing shapes and patterns is a creative way to understand and apply graphical programming concepts in QBasic. Using graphical commands like **PSET**, **LINE**, and **CIRCLE**, you can create various geometric shapes and artistic patterns. This chapter will explore how to draw basic shapes like squares, triangles, and circles, as well as complex patterns by combining multiple shapes.

## **40.2 Basics of Drawing Shapes**

Before drawing shapes, set the screen to graphics mode using the `SCREEN` command. For most patterns, use `SCREEN 12`, which provides high-resolution graphics.

### **Syntax**
```basic
SCREEN 12
```

## **40.3 Drawing Basic Shapes**

### **40.3.1 Squares and Rectangles**
Rectangles and squares are drawn using the **LINE** command with the `B` option for a box.

#### **Example: Drawing a Square**
```basic
SCREEN 12
LINE (100, 100)-(200, 200), 4, B  ' Red square
```

**Output:**
- A red square with corners `(100, 100)` and `(200, 200)`.

---

#### **Example: Drawing a Filled Rectangle**
```basic
SCREEN 12
LINE (150, 150)-(300, 250), 2, BF  ' Green filled rectangle
```

**Output:**
- A green filled rectangle.

---

### **40.3.2 Triangles**
Triangles can be drawn by connecting three points using the **LINE** command.

#### **Example: Drawing a Triangle**
```basic
SCREEN 12
LINE (200, 100)-(150, 200), 1  ' Blue side 1
LINE (150, 200)-(250, 200), 1  ' Blue side 2
LINE (250, 200)-(200, 100), 1  ' Blue side 3
```

**Output:**
- A blue triangle.

---

### **40.3.3 Circles**
Use the **CIRCLE** command to draw circles.

#### **Example: Drawing a Circle**
```basic
SCREEN 12
CIRCLE (200, 200), 50, 14  ' Yellow circle with radius 50
```

**Output:**
- A yellow circle with center `(200, 200)`.

---

## **40.4 Drawing Patterns**

### **40.4.1 Concentric Circles**
Concentric circles share the same center but have different radii.

#### **Example: Drawing Concentric Circles**
```basic
SCREEN 12
FOR radius = 20 TO 100 STEP 20
    CIRCLE (200, 200), radius, 2  ' Green circles
NEXT radius
```

**Explanation:**
- Draws green circles with radii increasing by 20 pixels.

**Output:**
- Multiple concentric circles centered at `(200, 200)`.

---

### **40.4.2 Grid of Squares**
A grid pattern can be created by drawing squares in a loop.

#### **Example: Drawing a Grid**
```basic
SCREEN 12
FOR x = 50 TO 250 STEP 50
    FOR y = 50 TO 250 STEP 50
        LINE (x, y)-(x + 40, y + 40), 4, B  ' Red squares
    NEXT y
NEXT x
```

**Explanation:**
- Draws a grid of red squares spaced evenly across the screen.

**Output:**
- A grid of squares.

---

### **40.4.3 Star Pattern**
A star can be drawn by connecting points on a circle.

#### **Example: Drawing a Star**
```basic
SCREEN 12
DIM x(5), y(5)

FOR i = 1 TO 5
    x(i) = 200 + 100 * COS((i * 144) * 3.14159 / 180)  ' X-coordinate
    y(i) = 200 + 100 * SIN((i * 144) * 3.14159 / 180)  ' Y-coordinate
NEXT i

FOR i = 1 TO 5
    j = i MOD 5 + 1
    LINE (x(i), y(i))-(x(j), y(j)), 14  ' Yellow lines
NEXT i
```

**Explanation:**
- Calculates the coordinates of a five-pointed star.
- Draws lines between the points to form a star.

**Output:**
- A yellow star.

## **40.5 Creating Advanced Patterns**

### **40.5.1 Spiral Pattern**
A spiral is drawn by gradually increasing the radius and angle of a circle.

#### **Example: Drawing a Spiral**
```basic
SCREEN 12
FOR angle = 0 TO 720 STEP 5
    x = 200 + angle * COS(angle * 3.14159 / 180)
    y = 200 + angle * SIN(angle * 3.14159 / 180)
    PSET (x, y), 7  ' White spiral
NEXT angle
```

**Explanation:**
- Uses trigonometry to calculate points along a spiral path.

**Output:**
- A white spiral originating from the center of the screen.

---

### **40.5.2 Checkerboard Pattern**
A checkerboard alternates colors in a grid pattern.

#### **Example: Drawing a Checkerboard**
```basic
SCREEN 12
FOR x = 50 TO 250 STEP 50
    FOR y = 50 TO 250 STEP 50
        IF (x + y) MOD 100 = 0 THEN
            LINE (x, y)-(x + 50, y + 50), 1, BF  ' Blue square
        ELSE
            LINE (x, y)-(x + 50, y + 50), 7, BF  ' White square
        END IF
    NEXT y
NEXT x
```

**Explanation:**
- Alternates blue and white squares in a grid.

**Output:**
- A checkerboard pattern.

---

### **40.5.3 Flower Pattern**
A flower-like pattern can be created using overlapping circles.

#### **Example: Drawing a Flower**
```basic
SCREEN 12
FOR angle = 0 TO 360 STEP 45
    x = 200 + 50 * COS(angle * 3.14159 / 180)
    y = 200 + 50 * SIN(angle * 3.14159 / 180)
    CIRCLE (x, y), 30, 4  ' Red petals
NEXT angle

CIRCLE (200, 200), 20, 2  ' Green center
```

**Explanation:**
- Draws red circles at equal intervals around a central green circle.

**Output:**
- A flower pattern with red petals and a green center.

## **40.6 Combining Patterns**

By combining the techniques above, you can create intricate designs.

### **Example: Complex Pattern**
```basic
SCREEN 12

' Outer pattern
FOR angle = 0 TO 360 STEP 30
    x = 200 + 100 * COS(angle * 3.14159 / 180)
    y = 200 + 100 * SIN(angle * 3.14159 / 180)
    CIRCLE (x, y), 20, 14  ' Yellow circles
NEXT angle

' Inner star
DIM x(5), y(5)
FOR i = 1 TO 5
    x(i) = 200 + 50 * COS((i * 144) * 3.14159 / 180)
    y(i) = 200 + 50 * SIN((i * 144) * 3.14159 / 180)
NEXT i

FOR i = 1 TO 5
    j = i MOD 5 + 1
    LINE (x(i), y(i))-(x(j), y(j)), 4  ' Red star lines
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
- A pattern with a yellow circular design and a red star in the center.
