# Declaring and Using Variables

## **6.1 Introduction**
Variables are essential building blocks in programming. They act as containers for storing data that can be used and modified throughout a program. In this chapter, you will learn how to declare, assign, and use variables effectively in QBasic, along with examples and best practices.

## **6.2 What is a Variable?**
A **variable** is a named memory location that stores a value. The value of a variable can change as the program executes. Variables make programs dynamic and reusable by enabling data manipulation.

Example:
```basic
age = 25  ' The variable "age" stores the value 25
```

---

## **6.3 Declaring Variables**
Before using a variable, you can declare it to define its type and purpose. Declaring variables helps the program understand how much memory to allocate and what kind of data the variable will store.

### **6.3.1 Syntax for Declaring Variables**
```basic
DIM variable_name AS data_type
```

### **6.3.2 Common Data Types in QBasic**
- **INTEGER**: Stores whole numbers (e.g., 10, 50).
- **SINGLE**: Stores decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, 5.67).
- **STRING**: Stores text (e.g., "Hello", "QBasic").
- **LONG**: Stores larger whole numbers.
- **DOUBLE**: Stores high-precision decimal numbers.

### **6.3.3 Examples of Declaring Variables**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER       ' Declares an integer variable
DIM name AS STRING       ' Declares a string variable
DIM price AS SINGLE      ' Declares a single-precision variable
```

---

## **6.4 Assigning Values to Variables**
Variables are assigned values using the assignment operator (`=`). Once a variable has been declared, you can assign a value to it.

### **6.4.1 Syntax for Assigning Values**
```basic
variable_name = value
```

### **6.4.2 Examples of Assigning Values**
```basic
age = 25                 ' Assigns the value 25 to the variable age
name = "Alice"           ' Assigns the string "Alice" to the variable name
price = 99.99            ' Assigns the value 99.99 to the variable price
```

---

## **6.5 Using Variables in Programs**
Variables can be used in calculations, displayed as output, or combined with other operations.

### **6.5.1 Example: Basic Program Using Variables**
```basic
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER

num1 = 10
num2 = 20
sum = num1 + num2

PRINT "The sum of "; num1; " and "; num2; " is "; sum
```

**Output:**
```
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
```

---

## **6.6 Input and Variables**
Variables can store values entered by the user using the `INPUT` command.

### **6.6.1 Example: Storing User Input**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your name: ", name
INPUT "Enter your age: ", age

PRINT "Hello "; name; ", you are "; age; " years old."
```

**Output (User enters "John" and "15"):**
```
Enter your name: John
Enter your age: 15
Hello John, you are 15 years old.
```

---

## **6.7 Modifying Variable Values**
Variables can be updated or modified as the program runs.

### **6.7.1 Example: Updating a Variable**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER

score = 50
PRINT "Initial score: "; score

score = score + 10
PRINT "Updated score: "; score
```

**Output:**
```
Initial score: 50
Updated score: 60
```

---

## **6.8 Best Practices for Using Variables**
1. **Use Descriptive Names:**
   - Avoid generic names like `x` or `y`. Use meaningful names like `age`, `price`, or `totalCost`.
   - Example:
     ```basic
     DIM studentName AS STRING
     ```

2. **Declare Variables Explicitly:**
   - Always declare variables using the `DIM` statement for better readability and to avoid errors.

3. **Avoid Using Uninitialized Variables:**
   - Ensure variables are assigned a value before they are used.
   - Example (Incorrect):
     ```basic
     PRINT result  ' Error: result has no value
     ```

4. **Use Consistent Naming Conventions:**
   - Follow consistent naming rules, such as using camelCase or underscores for multi-word variables.
   - Example:
     ```basic
     total_marks = 95
     ```

5. **Comment Your Code:**
   - Add comments to describe the purpose of variables.
   - Example:
     ```basic
     DIM radius AS SINGLE   ' The radius of the circle
     ```

## **6.9 Common Errors with Variables**
### **6.9.1 Using Variables Without Declaring Them**
QBasic may allow this but can lead to errors in larger programs.

### **6.9.2 Incorrect Data Types**
Assigning the wrong type of value to a variable can cause errors.
Example:
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER
age = "Alice"  ' Error: String assigned to an INTEGER variable
```

### **6.9.3 Name Conflicts**
Using the same name for multiple variables can cause confusion. Always use unique names.

## **6.10 Summary**
In this chapter, you learned how to declare and use variables in QBasic. Variables are crucial for storing and manipulating data, enabling you to create dynamic and interactive programs. By understanding how to declare variables, assign values, and use them in operations, you are now equipped to build more advanced programs.
