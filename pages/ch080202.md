# Responding to User Inputs for Graphics

## **42.1 Introduction**
Interactive graphics allow users to control the behavior of graphical elements on the screen using keyboard inputs. In QBasic, you can create programs that respond to user inputs in real-time by capturing key presses or mouse actions. This chapter explains how to integrate user inputs into graphics and create interactive programs.

## **42.2 Basics of User Input in QBasic**

### **Keyboard Input**
- **`INPUT` Command**: Captures user input but pauses the program until a key is pressed.
- **`INKEY$` Command**: Captures key presses without pausing the program, making it ideal for real-time interactivity.

### **Syntax for `INKEY$`**
```basic
key$ = INKEY$
```
- **`key$`**: Stores the pressed key as a string.

### **Mouse Input**
Mouse input handling is limited in QBasic and often requires external libraries, so this chapter focuses on keyboard input.

## **42.3 Setting Up Graphics Mode**
Interactive graphics require initializing a graphics mode using the `SCREEN` statement.

### **Example: Setting Graphics Mode**
```basic
SCREEN 12
```

## **42.4 Examples of Interactive Graphics**

### **42.4.1 Moving a Ball with Arrow Keys**
This example shows how to move a ball around the screen using the arrow keys.

#### **Code**
```basic
SCREEN 12

x = 320
y = 240

DO
    CLS
    CIRCLE (x, y), 20, 14  ' Draw the ball

    key$ = INKEY$
    SELECT CASE key$
        CASE CHR$(72)  ' Up arrow
            y = y - 10
        CASE CHR$(80)  ' Down arrow
            y = y + 10
        CASE CHR$(75)  ' Left arrow
            x = x - 10
        CASE CHR$(77)  ' Right arrow
            x = x + 10
    END SELECT

    ' Prevent the ball from moving out of bounds
    IF x < 20 THEN x = 20
    IF x > 620 THEN x = 620
    IF y < 20 THEN y = 20
    IF y > 460 THEN y = 460

    SLEEP 0.05
LOOP UNTIL key$ = CHR$(27)  ' Exit on ESC key
```

#### **Explanation:**
- The ball's position (`x, y`) updates based on arrow key inputs.
- `CHR$(72)`, `CHR$(80)`, `CHR$(75)`, and `CHR$(77)` correspond to the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys, respectively.
- The ball stays within screen bounds.

### **42.4.2 Drawing with Arrow Keys**
This example allows the user to draw on the screen using the arrow keys.

#### **Code**
```basic
SCREEN 12

x = 320
y = 240
color = 14  ' Yellow color

DO
    PSET (x, y), color  ' Plot the current point

    key$ = INKEY$
    SELECT CASE key$
        CASE CHR$(72)  ' Up arrow
            y = y - 5
        CASE CHR$(80)  ' Down arrow
            y = y + 5
        CASE CHR$(75)  ' Left arrow
            x = x - 5
        CASE CHR$(77)  ' Right arrow
            x = x + 5
        CASE "C"  ' Change color
            color = color + 1
            IF color > 15 THEN color = 1
    END SELECT

    ' Prevent the cursor from moving out of bounds
    IF x < 0 THEN x = 0
    IF x > 639 THEN x = 639
    IF y < 0 THEN y = 0
    IF y > 479 THEN y = 479

    SLEEP 0.05
LOOP UNTIL key$ = CHR$(27)  ' Exit on ESC key
```

#### **Explanation:**
- The user moves a "pen" using the arrow keys.
- Pressing `C` changes the drawing color.
- The `PSET` command plots points at the current position.

### **42.4.3 Controlling a Car**
This example simulates a car moving across the screen with user inputs.

#### **Code**
```basic
SCREEN 12

x = 50
y = 300

DO
    CLS

    ' Draw the car
    LINE (x, y)-(x + 100, y + 50), 7, BF  ' Car body
    CIRCLE (x + 20, y + 50), 10, 0        ' Left wheel
    CIRCLE (x + 80, y + 50), 10, 0        ' Right wheel

    key$ = INKEY$
    SELECT CASE key$
        CASE CHR$(75)  ' Left arrow
            x = x - 10
        CASE CHR$(77)  ' Right arrow
            x = x + 10
    END SELECT

    ' Keep the car within bounds
    IF x < 0 THEN x = 0
    IF x > 540 THEN x = 540

    SLEEP 0.05
LOOP UNTIL key$ = CHR$(27)  ' Exit on ESC key
```

#### **Explanation:**
- The car moves left or right based on arrow key inputs.
- The position (`x`) is restricted to the screen width.

### **42.4.4 Catch the Ball Game**
This example creates a simple game where the user catches a falling ball with a paddle.

#### **Code**
```basic
SCREEN 12

ballX = 320
ballY = 50
paddleX = 300
score = 0

DO
    CLS
    ' Draw the ball
    CIRCLE (ballX, ballY), 10, 14  ' Yellow ball

    ' Draw the paddle
    LINE (paddleX, 450)-(paddleX + 100, 460), 4  ' Red paddle

    ' Update ball position
    ballY = ballY + 5

    ' Check if the ball reaches the bottom
    IF ballY > 450 THEN
        IF ballX >= paddleX AND ballX <= paddleX + 100 THEN
            score = score + 1  ' Ball caught
            ballY = 50         ' Reset ball position
        ELSE
            PRINT "Game Over! Your score: "; score
            EXIT DO
        END IF
    END IF

    ' Move the paddle
    key$ = INKEY$
    IF key$ = CHR$(75) THEN paddleX = paddleX - 10  ' Left arrow
    IF key$ = CHR$(77) THEN paddleX = paddleX + 10  ' Right arrow

    ' Keep the paddle within bounds
    IF paddleX < 0 THEN paddleX = 0
    IF paddleX > 540 THEN paddleX = 540

    SLEEP 0.05
LOOP
```

#### **Explanation:**
- A ball falls from the top of the screen.
- The user moves a paddle to catch the ball.
- The game ends if the ball is missed.

## **42.5 Common Issues and Solutions**

1. **Unresponsive Keys:**
   - Ensure `INKEY$` is used instead of `INPUT` for real-time input.

2. **Objects Moving Out of Bounds:**
   - Use conditions to restrict movement within the screen dimensions.

3. **Overlapping Graphics:**
   - Clear the screen (`CLS`) before redrawing graphics.

---

## **42.6 Best Practices**

1. **Use Constants:**
   - Define keys (e.g., `CHR$(27)`) as constants for better readability.

2. **Plan User Interaction:**
   - Design intuitive controls for the user.

3. **Add Feedback:**
   - Display messages or scores to provide feedback.

4. **Optimize Speed:**
   - Adjust delay values for smooth and responsive animations.

## **42.7 Summary**
Interactive graphics in QBasic allow users to control shapes and animations using keyboard inputs. By combining `INKEY$` with graphical commands, you can create engaging applications like drawing tools, games, and simulations. This chapter covered fundamental techniques for handling user input and integrating it with graphics.
