# What Are Variables and Constants?

## **5.1 Introduction**
In programming, **variables** and **constants** are fundamental concepts used to store and manage data. They allow you to write flexible and reusable programs by enabling you to manipulate and access data during the execution of your program. This chapter explains what variables and constants are, their differences, and how to use them in QBasic.

## **5.2 Variables**
A **variable** is a name that represents a storage location in the computerâ€™s memory, where data can be stored, modified, and retrieved during the execution of a program. Variables are dynamic, meaning their values can change as the program runs.

### **5.2.1 Features of Variables**
- **Dynamic:** Variables can hold different values at different points in a program.
- **Named Storage:** Variables have names that make them easy to identify.
- **Type-Specific:** Variables can store specific types of data, such as numbers or text.

### **5.2.2 Declaring Variables in QBasic**
In QBasic, variables can be declared explicitly using the `DIM` statement or implicitly by directly assigning a value.

#### **Explicit Declaration:**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER  ' Declares a variable named age that holds integer values
```

#### **Implicit Declaration:**
```basic
age = 25  ' Assigns a value to the variable age without declaring it explicitly
```

### **5.2.3 Naming Variables**
When naming variables in QBasic, follow these rules:
1. **Start with a letter:** Variable names must begin with an alphabetic character (A-Z).
2. **No spaces or special characters:** Use underscores (`_`) if necessary, e.g., `first_name`.
3. **Keep it descriptive:** Use meaningful names like `score` or `temperature` to describe the data being stored.

### **5.2.4 Assigning Values to Variables**
Values are assigned to variables using the assignment operator (`=`).

Example:
```basic
price = 100       ' Assigns the value 100 to the variable price
name$ = "Alice"   ' Assigns the string "Alice" to the variable name$
```

## **5.3 Constants**
A **constant** is similar to a variable but with one key difference: its value cannot be changed after it has been assigned. Constants are used to store fixed values that remain the same throughout the program.

### **5.3.1 Features of Constants**
- **Immutable:** Once a constant is assigned a value, it cannot be modified.
- **Reliable:** Constants ensure that certain values remain consistent throughout the program.
- **Readable:** Using constants makes your program easier to read and maintain.

### **5.3.2 Declaring Constants in QBasic**
Constants are declared using the `CONST` statement.

Syntax:
```basic
CONST constant_name = value
```

Example:
```basic
CONST PI = 3.14159       ' Declares a constant PI with a value of 3.14159
CONST MAX_SCORE = 100    ' Declares a constant MAX_SCORE with a value of 100
```

## **5.4 Differences Between Variables and Constants**

| **Aspect**       | **Variable**                              | **Constant**                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Mutability**    | Can change during program execution       | Remains fixed throughout the program |
| **Declaration**   | `DIM` (optional) or direct assignment     | `CONST` statement                    |
| **Purpose**       | For storing data that changes dynamically | For storing data that stays constant |
| **Example**       | `score = 50`                             | `CONST MAX_SCORE = 100`              |

## **5.5 Examples of Using Variables and Constants**
### **5.5.1 Using Variables**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER
age = 15
PRINT "The student's age is "; age
```

Output:
```
The student's age is 15
```

### **5.5.2 Using Constants**
```basic
CONST PI = 3.14159
DIM radius AS SINGLE
radius = 5
area = PI * radius * radius
PRINT "The area of the circle is "; area
```

Output:
```
The area of the circle is 78.53975
```

## **5.6 Best Practices for Variables and Constants**
1. **Use Descriptive Names:** Clearly indicate the purpose of the variable or constant (e.g., `total_cost` instead of `x`).
2. **Minimize the Use of Magic Numbers:** Replace hardcoded values with constants for clarity and maintainability.
   - Example: Use `CONST TAX_RATE = 0.05` instead of directly writing `0.05` in your program.
3. **Use Constants for Fixed Values:** Declare constants for values that do not change, such as `PI`, `MAX_SCORE`, or tax rates.
4. **Comment Your Code:** Add comments to describe the purpose of variables and constants.

## **5.7 Summary**
Variables and constants are essential tools in programming. Variables store data that can change during program execution, while constants store fixed values that remain unchanged. By understanding how to declare, assign, and use these tools effectively, you can write clearer, more organized, and efficient programs.
