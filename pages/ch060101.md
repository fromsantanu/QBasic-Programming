# What are Subroutines? (Using `GOSUB`)

## **32.1 Introduction**
In older versions of QBasic or environments that do not support modern `SUB` routines, you can use `GOSUB` to create and manage subroutines. The `GOSUB` statement transfers control to a specific line in your program where the subroutine starts. Once the subroutine completes, the `RETURN` statement sends control back to the point where `GOSUB` was called.

This chapter introduces subroutines using `GOSUB` and explains their syntax, usage, and benefits with examples.

---

## **32.2 What is `GOSUB`?**

`GOSUB` allows you to define reusable blocks of code within your program. Each subroutine starts at a labeled line and ends with a `RETURN` statement. The program continues executing from the statement after the `GOSUB` call.

### **Syntax**
```basic
GOSUB label
...
label:
    ' Subroutine code
    RETURN
```

- **`GOSUB`**: Transfers control to the labeled subroutine.
- **`label`**: The starting point of the subroutine.
- **`RETURN`**: Returns control to the statement following the `GOSUB` call.

---

## **32.3 Benefits of Using `GOSUB`**

1. **Reusability**: Write code once and reuse it multiple times.
2. **Modularity**: Divide the program into smaller, manageable parts.
3. **Clarity**: Improves readability by separating tasks into subroutines.

## **32.4 Examples of Subroutines Using `GOSUB`**

### **32.4.1 Simple Subroutine**
#### **Example: Displaying a Message**
```basic
PRINT "Program Start"
GOSUB DisplayMessage
PRINT "Program End"
END

DisplayMessage:
    PRINT "Welcome to QBasic Subroutines!"
    RETURN
```

**Output:**
```
Program Start
Welcome to QBasic Subroutines!
Program End
```

---

### **32.4.2 Using Variables in Subroutines**
You can pass values to a subroutine by using global variables.

#### **Example: Adding Two Numbers**
```basic
DIM a AS INTEGER, b AS INTEGER

a = 5
b = 10

PRINT "Program Start"
GOSUB AddNumbers
PRINT "Program End"
END

AddNumbers:
    PRINT "The sum is: "; a + b
    RETURN
```

**Output:**
```
Program Start
The sum is: 15
Program End
```

---

### **32.4.3 Modular Code with Subroutines**
Divide your program into logical sections using `GOSUB`.

#### **Example: Rectangle Area and Perimeter**
```basic
DIM length AS INTEGER, width AS INTEGER

length = 5
width = 10

PRINT "Calculating Rectangle Properties"
GOSUB CalculateRectangle
PRINT "End of Program"
END

CalculateRectangle:
    PRINT "Area: "; length * width
    PRINT "Perimeter: "; 2 * (length + width)
    RETURN
```

**Output:**
```
Calculating Rectangle Properties
Area: 50
Perimeter: 30
End of Program
```

---

## **32.5 Reusable Subroutines**

### **Example: Checking Even or Odd**
```basic
DIM number AS INTEGER

number = 7
GOSUB CheckEvenOdd

number = 4
GOSUB CheckEvenOdd
END

CheckEvenOdd:
    IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        PRINT number; " is even."
    ELSE
        PRINT number; " is odd."
    END IF
    RETURN
```

**Output:**
```
7 is odd.
4 is even.
```

---

### **Example: Square and Cube Calculations**
```basic
DIM num AS INTEGER

num = 3
GOSUB CalculateSquare
GOSUB CalculateCube

num = 5
GOSUB CalculateSquare
GOSUB CalculateCube
END

CalculateSquare:
    PRINT "Square of "; num; " is "; num * num
    RETURN

CalculateCube:
    PRINT "Cube of "; num; " is "; num * num * num
    RETURN
```

**Output:**
```
Square of 3 is 9
Cube of 3 is 27
Square of 5 is 25
Cube of 5 is 125
```

---

## **32.6 Using Logic in Subroutines**

### **Example: Dynamic Operations**
```basic
DIM a AS INTEGER, b AS INTEGER

a = 8
b = 12
GOSUB CalculateValues
END

CalculateValues:
    PRINT "Sum: "; a + b
    PRINT "Difference: "; a - b
    PRINT "Product: "; a * b
    IF b <> 0 THEN
        PRINT "Quotient: "; a / b
    ELSE
        PRINT "Division by zero is not allowed."
    END IF
    RETURN
```

**Output:**
```
Sum: 20
Difference: -4
Product: 96
Quotient: 0.6666667
```

---

## **32.7 Common Errors with `GOSUB`**

1. **Missing `RETURN`:**
   - A subroutine must end with a `RETURN` statement to avoid errors.
   ```basic
   SubroutineName:
       PRINT "Message"
       ' Missing RETURN
   ```

2. **Jumping to Undefined Labels:**
   - Ensure the label for `GOSUB` exists in the program.
   ```basic
   GOSUB UndefinedLabel  ' Error: Undefined label
   ```

3. **Name Conflicts:**
   - Avoid using the same label name for multiple subroutines.

---

## **32.8 Best Practices for `GOSUB` Subroutines**

1. **Use Descriptive Labels:**
   - Name subroutine labels to indicate their purpose.
   ```basic
   AreaCalculation:
   ```

2. **Minimize Global Variables:**
   - Use variables carefully to avoid conflicts across subroutines.

3. **Document Code:**
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of subroutines.
   ```basic
   ' This subroutine calculates the rectangle's area and perimeter
   ```

4. **Keep Subroutines Short:**
   - Limit the length of subroutines to focus on one task.

---

## **32.9 Applications of `GOSUB` Subroutines**

### **Example: A Simple Calculator**
```basic
DIM a AS INTEGER, b AS INTEGER

a = 10
b = 5

GOSUB Add
GOSUB Subtract
GOSUB Multiply
GOSUB Divide

b = 0
GOSUB Divide
END

Add:
    PRINT "Sum: "; a + b
    RETURN

Subtract:
    PRINT "Difference: "; a - b
    RETURN

Multiply:
    PRINT "Product: "; a * b
    RETURN

Divide:
    IF b <> 0 THEN
        PRINT "Quotient: "; a / b
    ELSE
        PRINT "Division by zero is not allowed."
    END IF
    RETURN
```

**Output:**
```
Sum: 15
Difference: 5
Product: 50
Quotient: 2
Division by zero is not allowed.
```

## **32.10 Summary**
The `GOSUB` statement is a powerful way to implement subroutines in QBasic, especially in environments that do not support modern subroutine syntax. By using labeled sections and the `RETURN` statement, you can create reusable, modular blocks of code. Subroutines make programs easier to manage, debug, and extend. Mastering `GOSUB` will enhance your ability to organize complex programs effectively.

## **Using Subroutines to Perform Arithmetic Operations**

Subroutines in QBasic are a convenient way to perform tasks like arithmetic operations. By defining subroutines using the `SUB` and `END SUB` keywords, you can write reusable blocks of code and call them whenever needed using the `CALL` statement.

---

### **Example: Performing Basic Arithmetic Operations**

The following program demonstrates how to use subroutines to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:

```basic
CALL Add(10, 5)
CALL Subtract(10, 5)
CALL Multiply(10, 5)
CALL Divide(10, 5)
CALL Divide(10, 0)

SUB Add (a, b)
    PRINT "Sum: "; a + b
END SUB

SUB Subtract (a, b)
    PRINT "Difference: "; a - b
END SUB

SUB Multiply (a, b)
    PRINT "Product: "; a * b
END SUB

SUB Divide (a, b)
    IF b <> 0 THEN
        PRINT "Quotient: "; a / b
    ELSE
        PRINT "Division by zero is not allowed."
    END IF
END SUB
```

**Output:**
```
Sum: 15
Difference: 5
Product: 50
Quotient: 2
Division by zero is not allowed.
```

---

## **Practical Application: Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle**

In this example, subroutines calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle using its length and width as inputs:

```basic
CALL CalculateArea(5, 10)
CALL CalculatePerimeter(5, 10)

SUB CalculateArea (length, width)
    PRINT "Area: "; length * width
END SUB

SUB CalculatePerimeter (length, width)
    PRINT "Perimeter: "; 2 * (length + width)
END SUB
```

**Output:**
```
Area: 50
Perimeter: 30
```

---

## **Subroutine with Conditional Logic**

Subroutines can include conditional statements to handle specific scenarios. For example, the following subroutine checks if a number is even or odd:

```basic
CALL CheckEvenOdd(7)
CALL CheckEvenOdd(4)

SUB CheckEvenOdd (number)
    IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        PRINT number; " is even."
    ELSE
        PRINT number; " is odd."
    END IF
END SUB
```

**Output:**
```
7 is odd.
4 is even.
```

---

## **Best Practices for Using Subroutines**

1. **Use Descriptive Names:**
   - Name subroutines to clearly indicate their purpose, such as `Add`, `CalculateArea`, or `CheckEvenOdd`.

2. **Pass Parameters:**
   - Use parameters to make subroutines flexible and reusable with different inputs.

3. **Include Conditional Logic:**
   - Handle special cases (e.g., division by zero) within the subroutine to prevent errors.

4. **Organize Code:**
   - Define subroutines at the end of your program to keep the main program logic clear and concise.
