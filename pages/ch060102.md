# Writing and Calling Subroutines

## **33.1 Introduction**
Subroutines are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. In QBasic, you can implement subroutines using two approaches:
1. **GOSUB and RETURN**: Suitable for older versions or environments where modern subroutines are unavailable.
2. **SUB and END SUB**: Allows for better modularity and organization, available in advanced QBasic interpreters.

This chapter explains how to write and call subroutines using both methods, with practical examples for each.

## **33.2 Subroutines Using `GOSUB` and `RETURN`**

The `GOSUB` statement transfers control to a labeled section of the program, called a subroutine. The subroutine ends with `RETURN`, which sends control back to the statement following the `GOSUB` call.

### **Syntax**
```basic
GOSUB label
...
label:
    ' Subroutine logic
    RETURN
```

---

### **Example: Performing Basic Arithmetic Operations**
```basic
DIM a AS INTEGER, b AS INTEGER
a = 10
b = 5

PRINT "Program Start"
GOSUB Add
GOSUB Subtract
GOSUB Multiply
GOSUB Divide
b = 0
GOSUB Divide
PRINT "Program End"
END

Add:
    PRINT "Sum: "; a + b
    RETURN

Subtract:
    PRINT "Difference: "; a - b
    RETURN

Multiply:
    PRINT "Product: "; a * b
    RETURN

Divide:
    IF b <> 0 THEN
        PRINT "Quotient: "; a / b
    ELSE
        PRINT "Division by zero is not allowed."
    END IF
    RETURN
```

**Output:**
```
Program Start
Sum: 15
Difference: 5
Product: 50
Quotient: 2
Division by zero is not allowed.
Program End
```

### **Example: Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle**
```basic
DIM length AS INTEGER, width AS INTEGER
length = 5
width = 10

PRINT "Calculating Rectangle Properties"
GOSUB CalculateArea
GOSUB CalculatePerimeter
PRINT "End of Program"
END

CalculateArea:
    PRINT "Area: "; length * width
    RETURN

CalculatePerimeter:
    PRINT "Perimeter: "; 2 * (length + width)
    RETURN
```

**Output:**
```
Calculating Rectangle Properties
Area: 50
Perimeter: 30
End of Program
```

## **33.3 Subroutines Using `SUB` and `END SUB`**

The `SUB` statement allows you to define a subroutine as a modular code block. Subroutines are invoked using the `CALL` statement.

### **Syntax**
```basic
CALL SubroutineName(parameters)

SUB SubroutineName (parameters)
    ' Subroutine logic
END SUB
```

---

### **Example: Performing Basic Arithmetic Operations**
```basic
CALL Add(10, 5)
CALL Subtract(10, 5)
CALL Multiply(10, 5)
CALL Divide(10, 5)
CALL Divide(10, 0)

SUB Add (a, b)
    PRINT "Sum: "; a + b
END SUB

SUB Subtract (a, b)
    PRINT "Difference: "; a - b
END SUB

SUB Multiply (a, b)
    PRINT "Product: "; a * b
END SUB

SUB Divide (a, b)
    IF b <> 0 THEN
        PRINT "Quotient: "; a / b
    ELSE
        PRINT "Division by zero is not allowed."
    END IF
END SUB
```

**Output:**
```
Sum: 15
Difference: 5
Product: 50
Quotient: 2
Division by zero is not allowed.
```

---

### **Example: Rectangle Calculations**
```basic
CALL CalculateArea(5, 10)
CALL CalculatePerimeter(5, 10)

SUB CalculateArea (length, width)
    PRINT "Area: "; length * width
END SUB

SUB CalculatePerimeter (length, width)
    PRINT "Perimeter: "; 2 * (length + width)
END SUB
```

**Output:**
```
Area: 50
Perimeter: 30
```

---

### **Example: Checking Even or Odd**
```basic
CALL CheckEvenOdd(7)
CALL CheckEvenOdd(4)

SUB CheckEvenOdd (number)
    IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        PRINT number; " is even."
    ELSE
        PRINT number; " is odd."
    END IF
END SUB
```

**Output:**
```
7 is odd.
4 is even.
```

## **33.4 Comparison of `GOSUB` and `SUB`**

| **Feature**               | **GOSUB**                                    | **SUB**                                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**                | Simple, uses labels for subroutine names.    | Uses structured syntax with `SUB`/`END SUB`.|
| **Parameters**            | Cannot pass parameters directly.             | Can pass parameters directly.              |
| **Readability**           | Less readable for complex programs.          | Highly readable and modular.               |
| **Reusability**           | Limited, relies on global variables.         | Excellent, supports flexible parameter passing. |

## **33.5 Best Practices for Using Subroutines**

1. **Choose the Right Approach:**
   - Use `GOSUB` for simpler tasks or when limited by interpreter capabilities.
   - Use `SUB` for better modularity and parameter handling.

2. **Use Descriptive Names:**
   - Label `GOSUB` routines clearly or name `SUB` routines meaningfully.

3. **Validate Inputs:**
   - Check input values within the subroutine to avoid errors (e.g., division by zero).

4. **Document Subroutines:**
   - Add comments explaining the purpose of each subroutine.

---

## **33.6 Summary**
Subroutines are a powerful way to organize and reuse code in QBasic. You can implement them using either `GOSUB` with labels or `SUB` with `CALL`. While `GOSUB` provides a simpler structure, `SUB` allows for more modular and parameterized subroutine definitions. Mastering both approaches equips you to handle a variety of programming scenarios effectively.
