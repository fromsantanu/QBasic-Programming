# Storing Data in Files

## **37.1 Introduction**
In programming, files are commonly used to store data persistently. In QBasic, you can store structured and unstructured data in text files, enabling programs to save and retrieve information across sessions. This chapter explains how to store data in files effectively, including writing data line-by-line, handling structured data, and using appropriate file modes.

## **37.2 Basics of File Storage in QBasic**

### **File Modes for Writing Data**
- **Output Mode**: Used to create a new file or overwrite an existing file.
- **Append Mode**: Used to add data to the end of an existing file without overwriting.

### **Commands for Writing Data**
- **`OPEN`**: Opens a file in the desired mode.
- **`PRINT #`**: Writes data to the file.
- **`CLOSE`**: Closes the file after operations are complete.

## **37.3 Writing Data to a File**

### **37.3.1 Writing Single-Line Data**
Use the `PRINT #` command to write text or numbers to a file.

#### **Example: Writing a Greeting Message**
```basic
OPEN "greetings.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
PRINT #1, "Hello, Welcome to QBasic!"
CLOSE #1
```

**Explanation:**
- Opens the file `greetings.txt` in `OUTPUT` mode.
- Writes a single line of text to the file.
- Closes the file to ensure the data is saved.

**Output in `greetings.txt`:**
```
Hello, Welcome to QBasic!
```

### **37.3.2 Writing Multiple Lines**
To store multiple lines of data, use a loop with `PRINT #`.

#### **Example: Writing a List of Names**
```basic
OPEN "names.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1

FOR i = 1 TO 3
    INPUT "Enter a name: ", name$
    PRINT #1, name$
NEXT i

CLOSE #1
```

**Explanation:**
- Opens `names.txt` in `OUTPUT` mode.
- Prompts the user to enter three names and writes them to the file.
- Closes the file after writing.

**Input:**
```
Enter a name: Alice
Enter a name: Bob
Enter a name: Charlie
```

**Output in `names.txt`:**
```
Alice
Bob
Charlie
```

## **37.4 Storing Structured Data**

When storing structured data like records, use delimiters (e.g., commas or tabs) to separate fields.

### **Example: Storing Employee Records**
```basic
OPEN "employees.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1

FOR i = 1 TO 2
    INPUT "Enter employee name: ", name$
    INPUT "Enter employee ID: ", empID
    PRINT #1, name$; ","; empID
NEXT i

CLOSE #1
```

**Explanation:**
- Opens `employees.txt` in `OUTPUT` mode.
- Prompts the user to enter the name and ID of two employees.
- Writes each record to the file in a comma-separated format.

**Input:**
```
Enter employee name: Alice
Enter employee ID: 101
Enter employee name: Bob
Enter employee ID: 102
```

**Output in `employees.txt`:**
```
Alice,101
Bob,102
```

---

## **37.5 Appending Data to a File**

### **Example: Adding More Records**
Use `APPEND` mode to add data without overwriting existing content.

```basic
OPEN "employees.txt" FOR APPEND AS #1

FOR i = 1 TO 1
    INPUT "Enter employee name: ", name$
    INPUT "Enter employee ID: ", empID
    PRINT #1, name$; ","; empID
NEXT i

CLOSE #1
```

**Input:**
```
Enter employee name: Charlie
Enter employee ID: 103
```

**Updated `employees.txt`:**
```
Alice,101
Bob,102
Charlie,103
```

---

## **37.6 Storing Numerical Data**

### **Example: Saving a Series of Numbers**
```basic
OPEN "numbers.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1

FOR i = 1 TO 5
    PRINT #1, i * 10
NEXT i

CLOSE #1
```

**Explanation:**
- Saves the series `10, 20, 30, 40, 50` to `numbers.txt`.

**Output in `numbers.txt`:**
```
10
20
30
40
50
```

---

## **37.7 Reading and Updating Stored Data**

### **Example: Updating Employee Records**
```basic
OPEN "employees.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1
OPEN "temp.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #2

DO WHILE NOT EOF(1)
    LINE INPUT #1, line$
    INPUT "Edit this record (Y/N)? ", choice$
    IF UCASE$(choice$) = "Y" THEN
        INPUT "Enter new employee name: ", name$
        INPUT "Enter new employee ID: ", empID
        PRINT #2, name$; ","; empID
    ELSE
        PRINT #2, line$
    END IF
LOOP

CLOSE #1
CLOSE #2

KILL "employees.txt"
NAME "temp.txt" AS "employees.txt"
```

**Explanation:**
- Reads `employees.txt` line-by-line.
- Prompts the user to update each record or leave it unchanged.
- Saves the updated data to a temporary file and replaces the original file.

## **37.8 Storing Data for Future Processing**

### **Example: Saving Quiz Scores**
```basic
OPEN "scores.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1

FOR i = 1 TO 3
    INPUT "Enter student name: ", name$
    INPUT "Enter score: ", score
    PRINT #1, name$; ","; score
NEXT i

CLOSE #1
```

**Input:**
```
Enter student name: Alice
Enter score: 85
Enter student name: Bob
Enter score: 90
Enter student name: Charlie
Enter score: 78
```

**Output in `scores.txt`:**
```
Alice,85
Bob,90
Charlie,78
```

## **37.9 Common Errors in File Storage**

1. **File Not Found:**
   - Use `OUTPUT` mode to create a new file if it doesn't exist.

2. **File Already Open:**
   - Ensure you close the file before reopening it in a different mode.

3. **Invalid File Number:**
   - Use a valid file number between 1 and 255.

4. **Data Overwritten:**
   - Use `APPEND` mode to avoid overwriting existing data.

---

## **37.10 Best Practices for File Storage**

1. **Choose Appropriate Delimiters:**
   - Use commas, tabs, or other delimiters to store structured data.

2. **Always Close Files:**
   - Use `CLOSE` to save changes and free system resources.

3. **Validate Input:**
   - Ensure data entered by the user is valid before writing to the file.

4. **Backup Important Files:**
   - Create backups before performing operations that modify data.

5. **Use Error Handling:**
   - Check for file existence and handle errors gracefully.

## **37.11 Summary**
Storing data in files allows programs to save information for future use. Using QBasicâ€™s file handling features, you can write, append, and structure data efficiently. Mastering file storage enables you to build applications that require persistent data, such as record-keeping systems, quiz programs, or data analysis tools.
