# Designing and Presenting a Simple Project

## **45.1 Introduction**
After learning key programming concepts, the best way to consolidate knowledge is through hands-on application. In this chapter, students will design, build, and present a simple project that integrates the concepts they have learned, such as loops, conditionals, graphics, file handling, and user input. This activity fosters creativity, problem-solving, and a deeper understanding of programming.

---

## **45.2 Objectives**
1. **Apply Concepts**: Use programming knowledge to solve a practical problem.
2. **Collaborate**: Work in groups to brainstorm and develop the project.
3. **Communicate**: Present the project to peers, explaining its purpose and implementation.

---

## **45.3 Steps to Complete the Project**

### **Step 1: Brainstorm Project Ideas**
Encourage students to think of projects that align with their interests and apply programming concepts. Examples include:
- **Interactive Games**: Number guessing game, tic-tac-toe, or a maze.
- **Educational Tools**: Multiplication quiz, spelling tutor, or a geometry visualizer.
- **Utility Programs**: Simple calculators, inventory management, or a student record system.

### **Step 2: Define Project Goals**
Students should outline:
1. **Purpose**: What problem does the project solve?
2. **Audience**: Who will use the project?
3. **Key Features**: What are the primary functionalities?

### **Step 3: Plan the Project**
Create a project plan that includes:
- **Flowchart**: A diagram showing how the program works.
- **Features**: A list of features to implement.
- **Timeline**: Estimated time for each stage of development.

### **Step 4: Write and Test the Code**
Students should:
1. Divide the project into smaller modules or subroutines.
2. Write code for each module and test it individually.
3. Combine modules and test the complete program.

### **Step 5: Prepare the Presentation**
The presentation should include:
- **Project Overview**: The purpose and target audience.
- **Demo**: Showcase the working project.
- **Challenges**: Discuss difficulties faced and how they were overcome.
- **Conclusion**: Highlight lessons learned.

## **45.4 Example Projects**

### **Project 1: Multiplication Quiz**
**Purpose**: Help students practice multiplication.

#### **Features**:
- Randomly generate multiplication problems.
- Track the number of correct answers.
- Save scores to a file.

#### **Code Outline**:
```basic
SCREEN 12
RANDOMIZE TIMER

DIM correct AS INTEGER
DIM attempts AS INTEGER
correct = 0
attempts = 0

OPEN "scores.txt" FOR APPEND AS #1
DO
    num1 = INT(RND * 10) + 1
    num2 = INT(RND * 10) + 1
    correctAnswer = num1 * num2

    INPUT "What is "; num1; " * "; num2; " ? ", userAnswer
    attempts = attempts + 1

    IF userAnswer = correctAnswer THEN
        PRINT "Correct!"
        correct = correct + 1
    ELSE
        PRINT "Wrong! The correct answer is "; correctAnswer
    END IF

    INPUT "Do you want to try another question? (Y/N): ", continue$
LOOP UNTIL UCASE$(continue$) = "N"

PRINT "You answered "; correct; " out of "; attempts; " questions correctly."
PRINT #1, "Score: "; correct; " / "; attempts
CLOSE #1
```

### **Project 2: Simple Drawing Tool**
**Purpose**: Allow users to draw on the screen using arrow keys.

#### **Features**:
- Move a "pen" with arrow keys.
- Change pen color.
- Clear the screen.

#### **Code Outline**:
```basic
SCREEN 12

x = 320
y = 240
color = 14  ' Yellow

DO
    PSET (x, y), color
    key$ = INKEY$
    SELECT CASE key$
        CASE CHR$(72)  ' Up arrow
            y = y - 5
        CASE CHR$(80)  ' Down arrow
            y = y + 5
        CASE CHR$(75)  ' Left arrow
            x = x - 5
        CASE CHR$(77)  ' Right arrow
            x = x + 5
        CASE "C"  ' Change color
            color = (color MOD 15) + 1
        CASE "R"  ' Reset screen
            CLS
    END SELECT
LOOP UNTIL key$ = CHR$(27)  ' Exit on ESC key
```

### **Project 3: Student Record System**
**Purpose**: Manage and display student information.

#### **Features**:
- Add student records.
- View all records.
- Search for a student.

#### **Code Outline**:
```basic
DIM names$(100), rollNos(100) AS INTEGER, marks(100) AS SINGLE
DIM studentCount AS INTEGER
studentCount = 0

DO
    PRINT "1. Add Student"
    PRINT "2. View Students"
    PRINT "3. Search Student"
    PRINT "4. Exit"
    INPUT "Choose an option: ", choice

    SELECT CASE choice
        CASE 1
            INPUT "Enter name: ", names$(studentCount + 1)
            INPUT "Enter roll number: ", rollNos(studentCount + 1)
            INPUT "Enter marks: ", marks(studentCount + 1)
            studentCount = studentCount + 1
        CASE 2
            FOR i = 1 TO studentCount
                PRINT rollNos(i); TAB(10); names$(i); TAB(20); marks(i)
            NEXT i
        CASE 3
            INPUT "Enter roll number to search: ", roll
            FOR i = 1 TO studentCount
                IF rollNos(i) = roll THEN
                    PRINT "Name: "; names$(i)
                    PRINT "Marks: "; marks(i)
                END IF
            NEXT i
        CASE 4
            PRINT "Goodbye!"
            EXIT DO
        CASE ELSE
            PRINT "Invalid option. Try again."
    END SELECT
LOOP
