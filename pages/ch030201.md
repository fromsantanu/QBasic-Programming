# The `FOR...NEXT` Loop

## **14.1 Introduction**
The `FOR...NEXT` loop is a powerful control structure in QBasic used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times. It is ideal for situations where you know in advance how many times the loop should run. 

This chapter covers the syntax, usage, and examples of the `FOR...NEXT` loop, along with common mistakes and best practices.

## **14.2 What is a `FOR...NEXT` Loop?**
The `FOR...NEXT` loop runs a block of code multiple times, controlling the loop using a counter variable that increments or decrements with each iteration.

### **Syntax**
```basic
FOR counter = start TO end [STEP increment]
    [statements]
NEXT counter
```

- **`counter`**: A variable used as the loop counter.
- **`start`**: The initial value of the counter.
- **`end`**: The final value of the counter.
- **`STEP increment`**: (Optional) Specifies how much the counter changes after each iteration. Default is `1`.

## **14.3 Using the `FOR...NEXT` Loop**
### **14.3.1 Basic Loop**
```basic
FOR i = 1 TO 5
    PRINT "Iteration: "; i
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
```

---

### **14.3.2 Loop with Step Value**
You can use the `STEP` keyword to control how much the counter changes in each iteration.

#### Example: Increment by 2
```basic
FOR i = 1 TO 10 STEP 2
    PRINT "Value: "; i
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
Value: 1
Value: 3
Value: 5
Value: 7
Value: 9
```

#### Example: Decrementing Loop
```basic
FOR i = 10 TO 1 STEP -1
    PRINT "Countdown: "; i
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
Countdown: 10
Countdown: 9
Countdown: 8
Countdown: 7
Countdown: 6
Countdown: 5
Countdown: 4
Countdown: 3
Countdown: 2
Countdown: 1
```

## **14.4 Nested `FOR...NEXT` Loops**
You can place one `FOR...NEXT` loop inside another to handle multidimensional iterations.

### **Example: Multiplication Table**
```basic
FOR i = 1 TO 5
    FOR j = 1 TO 5
        PRINT i; " x "; j; " = "; i * j
    NEXT j
    PRINT   ' Add a blank line for better readability
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
1 x 4 = 4
1 x 5 = 5

2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
...
```

## **14.5 Controlling Loop Execution**
You can use statements like `EXIT FOR` to break out of a loop prematurely.

### **Example: Exiting a Loop**
```basic
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    IF i = 5 THEN
        PRINT "Exiting loop at i = "; i
        EXIT FOR
    END IF
    PRINT "Value: "; i
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
Value: 1
Value: 2
Value: 3
Value: 4
Exiting loop at i = 5
```

---

## **14.6 Common Errors with `FOR...NEXT`**
1. **Missing `NEXT` Statement:**
   Forgetting the `NEXT` statement causes a syntax error.
   ```basic
   FOR i = 1 TO 5
       PRINT i
   ' Missing NEXT i
   ```

2. **Infinite Loop:**
   Improper use of `STEP` can lead to an infinite loop.
   ```basic
   FOR i = 1 TO 5 STEP -1   ' Will never reach 5
       PRINT i
   NEXT i
   ```

3. **Uninitialized Counter:**
   Using a counter without proper initialization can result in unpredictable behavior.

## **14.7 Applications of `FOR...NEXT` Loops**
### **14.7.1 Calculating Sums**
```basic
DIM sum AS INTEGER
sum = 0

FOR i = 1 TO 10
    sum = sum + i
NEXT i

PRINT "The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is "; sum
```

**Output:**
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is 55
```

---

### **14.7.2 Generating Patterns**
```basic
FOR i = 1 TO 5
    FOR j = 1 TO i
        PRINT "*";
    NEXT j
    PRINT
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

## **14.8 Best Practices for `FOR...NEXT` Loops**
1. **Use Meaningful Counter Names:**
   - Use descriptive names for the counter variable.
   ```basic
   FOR studentIndex = 1 TO totalStudents
   ```

2. **Avoid Hardcoding Limits:**
   - Use variables for loop limits instead of hardcoded values.
   ```basic
   DIM maxValue AS INTEGER
   maxValue = 10
   FOR i = 1 TO maxValue
   ```

3. **Break Out Early When Necessary:**
   - Use `EXIT FOR` when you need to stop the loop based on a condition.

4. **Indent Code:**
   - Indent the loop body for better readability.
   ```basic
   FOR i = 1 TO 5
       PRINT i
   NEXT i
   ```

5. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Verify behavior for loop limits, such as when the `start` equals `end`.

## **14.9 Summary**
The `FOR...NEXT` loop is a versatile tool in QBasic for executing repetitive tasks. By understanding its syntax, step values, and use cases, you can create efficient programs for tasks like calculations, pattern generation, and more. With nested loops and controlled execution, the `FOR...NEXT` loop becomes a powerful programming construct.
