# Building a Number Guessing Game

## **44.1 Introduction**
A number guessing game is a simple yet entertaining program that tests the user's ability to guess a randomly chosen number within a range. This game helps to practice programming concepts like loops, conditional statements, and random number generation. In this chapter, we will create a number guessing game in QBasic.

---

## **44.2 Features of the Game**
1. **Random Number Generation**: The program generates a random number for the user to guess.
2. **User Feedback**: Provides hints such as "Too High" or "Too Low" to guide the user.
3. **Attempts Tracking**: Counts the number of guesses taken by the user.
4. **Replay Option**: Allows the user to play again after finishing a game.

---

## **44.3 Designing the Game**
The game will use:
- **`RND`**: To generate a random number.
- **Loops**: To allow multiple guesses until the correct number is found.
- **Conditional Statements**: To check if the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
- **Replay Mechanism**: To reset the game for a new round.

## **44.4 Number Guessing Game Code**

### **Program Code**
```basic
SCREEN 12

DO
    RANDOMIZE TIMER  ' Initialize random number generator
    secretNumber = INT(RND * 100) + 1  ' Random number between 1 and 100
    attempts = 0
    guessed = 0  ' Flag to check if the number is guessed

    PRINT "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!"
    PRINT "I have chosen a number between 1 and 100."
    PRINT "Try to guess it!"

    DO
        INPUT "Enter your guess: ", userGuess
        attempts = attempts + 1

        IF userGuess = secretNumber THEN
            PRINT "Congratulations! You guessed it in "; attempts; " attempts."
            guessed = 1
        ELSEIF userGuess < secretNumber THEN
            PRINT "Too Low! Try again."
        ELSE
            PRINT "Too High! Try again."
        END IF
    LOOP UNTIL guessed = 1

    PRINT "Do you want to play again? (Y/N)"
    INPUT "Enter your choice: ", playAgain$
    playAgain$ = UCASE$(playAgain$)  ' Convert to uppercase for consistency
LOOP WHILE playAgain$ = "Y"

PRINT "Thank you for playing! Goodbye!"
END
```

## **44.5 Explanation of the Code**

### **Random Number Generation**
- **`RND`** generates a random number between 0 and 1.
- Multiplying by 100 and adding 1 ensures the range is between 1 and 100.
- **`RANDOMIZE TIMER`** ensures a new random number is generated each time the program runs.

### **Taking User Input**
- The **`INPUT`** statement takes the user's guess.

### **Providing Feedback**
- The program uses **`IF...ELSEIF...ELSE`** to check if the guess is:
  - **Correct**: Congratulates the user and displays the number of attempts.
  - **Too Low**: Asks the user to guess a higher number.
  - **Too High**: Asks the user to guess a lower number.

### **Counting Attempts**
- A counter (`attempts`) increments with each guess, keeping track of the number of attempts.

### **Replay Option**
- After each game, the user can choose to play again by entering "Y" or "N".

## **44.6 Sample Interaction**

### **Game Start**
```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have chosen a number between 1 and 100.
Try to guess it!
Enter your guess: 50
Too Low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too High! Try again.
Enter your guess: 62
Congratulations! You guessed it in 3 attempts.
Do you want to play again? (Y/N)
Enter your choice: Y
```

### **Game Over**
```
Enter your choice: N
Thank you for playing! Goodbye!
```

## **44.7 Extending the Game**

### **1. Adding Difficulty Levels**
Allow users to choose a range for the random number:
```basic
PRINT "Choose difficulty level:"
PRINT "1. Easy (1 to 50)"
PRINT "2. Medium (1 to 100)"
PRINT "3. Hard (1 to 200)"
INPUT "Enter your choice (1-3): ", difficulty

SELECT CASE difficulty
    CASE 1
        maxRange = 50
    CASE 2
        maxRange = 100
    CASE 3
        maxRange = 200
    CASE ELSE
        PRINT "Invalid choice. Defaulting to Medium."
        maxRange = 100
END SELECT

secretNumber = INT(RND * maxRange) + 1
```

### **2. Adding a Guess Limit**
Limit the number of guesses allowed:
```basic
maxAttempts = 10
DO WHILE attempts < maxAttempts AND guessed = 0
    INPUT "Enter your guess: ", userGuess
    ...
LOOP

IF guessed = 0 THEN
    PRINT "Game Over! You ran out of attempts."
    PRINT "The secret number was "; secretNumber; "."
```

### **3. Displaying a Score**
Award points based on the number of attempts:
```basic
score = 100 - (attempts * 5)
IF score < 0 THEN score = 0
PRINT "Your score: "; score
```

## **44.8 Common Issues and Solutions**

1. **Invalid Input:**
   - Add validation to ensure the user enters a number within the range.

2. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - Use `UCASE$` to handle both uppercase and lowercase inputs for replay options.

3. **Random Number Repetition:**
   - Use `RANDOMIZE TIMER` to avoid generating the same random number in consecutive games.

---

## **44.9 Best Practices**

1. **Provide Clear Instructions:**
   - Ensure the user understands the rules and input format.

2. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - Validate inputs and provide appropriate error messages for invalid guesses.

3. **Keep Track of User Feedback:**
   - Offer encouraging messages for close guesses or repeated attempts.

4. **Test Thoroughly:**
   - Test the game with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

## **44.10 Summary**
The number guessing game demonstrates the use of random numbers, loops, conditional statements, and user interaction in QBasic. With features like feedback, attempt tracking, and replay options, it provides a fun and interactive experience. You can extend the game further by adding difficulty levels, score tracking, or a graphical interface.
