# The `INPUT` Command to Take User Input

## **8.1 Introduction**
The `INPUT` command in QBasic allows programs to interact with users by accepting data as input during program execution. This makes programs dynamic and personalized, as they can perform operations based on the user's input.

In this chapter, you will learn how to use the `INPUT` command, store user input in variables, and validate the input for better program functionality.

---

## **8.2 What is the `INPUT` Command?**
The `INPUT` command prompts the user to enter data during the execution of a program. The entered data is then stored in a variable for further use.

### **8.2.1 Syntax of the `INPUT` Command**
```basic
INPUT "Prompt message: ", variable_name
```

- **"Prompt message"**: A message displayed to guide the user about what to enter.
- **variable_name**: The variable that stores the user's input.

---

## **8.3 Using the `INPUT` Command**
The `INPUT` command can handle different types of data, including numbers, text, and even calculations.

### **8.3.1 Example: Taking a Simple Input**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your name: ", name
PRINT "Hello, "; name; "!"
```

**Output:**
```
Enter your name: Alice
Hello, Alice!
```

---

## **8.4 Accepting Numerical Input**
The `INPUT` command can also take numeric input, which is automatically stored in a variable of a compatible type.

### **Example: Taking a Numeric Input**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
PRINT "You are "; age; " years old."
```

**Output:**
```
Enter your age: 15
You are 15 years old.
```

---

## **8.5 Using Input in Calculations**
The data provided by the user can be directly used in calculations and displayed as output.

### **Example: Simple Calculation**
```basic
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter the first number: ", num1
INPUT "Enter the second number: ", num2

sum = num1 + num2
PRINT "The sum of "; num1; " and "; num2; " is "; sum
```

**Output:**
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 20
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
```

---

## **8.6 Accepting String Input**
For string input, declare the variable as `STRING` type. The `INPUT` command automatically treats text entered by the user as a string.

### **Example: Combining String Input**
```basic
DIM firstName AS STRING
DIM lastName AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your first name: ", firstName
INPUT "Enter your last name: ", lastName

PRINT "Your full name is "; firstName; " "; lastName
```

**Output:**
```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Your full name is John Doe
```

---

## **8.7 Providing Default Values**
QBasic allows you to initialize a variable with a default value, which can be overwritten by user input.

### **Example: Default Input**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER
score = 0

INPUT "Enter your score (default is "; score; "): ", score
PRINT "Your score is "; score
```

**Output:**
```
Enter your score (default is 0): 95
Your score is 95
```

---

## **8.8 Handling Multiple Inputs**
The `INPUT` command can accept multiple values separated by commas in a single line.

### **Example: Taking Multiple Inputs**
```basic
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter two numbers separated by a comma: ", num1, num2
PRINT "You entered "; num1; " and "; num2
```

**Output:**
```
Enter two numbers separated by a comma: 5, 10
You entered 5 and 10
```

---

## **8.9 Validating User Input**
Validation ensures the user enters appropriate data. While QBasic itself doesn't have built-in validation, you can implement it using conditional statements.

### **Example: Validating Numeric Input**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age

IF age < 0 THEN
    PRINT "Age cannot be negative."
ELSE
    PRINT "Your age is "; age
END IF
```

**Output:**
```
Enter your age: -5
Age cannot be negative.
```

## **8.10 Common Errors and How to Handle Them**
### **8.10.1 Input Mismatch**
Entering a non-numeric value when a numeric variable is expected causes an error.

**Solution:** Ensure the user knows the expected input type by providing a clear prompt.

### **8.10.2 Invalid Inputs**
Invalid inputs like leaving the input field blank can be handled using default values or conditional checks.

---

## **8.11 Best Practices for the `INPUT` Command**
1. **Use Clear Prompts:** Always provide clear and concise messages to guide the user.
   ```basic
   INPUT "Enter your age in years: ", age
   ```
2. **Validate User Input:** Include checks to ensure valid data is entered.
3. **Use Meaningful Variables:** Choose descriptive variable names to make your code easier to understand.
   ```basic
   DIM userAge AS INTEGER
   INPUT "Enter your age: ", userAge
   ```
4. **Provide Default Values:** Initialize variables with default values when possible.

## **8.12 Summary**
The `INPUT` command is a powerful tool for making programs interactive. By understanding how to use it for text and numerical input, as well as how to handle multiple inputs and validate user entries, you can create dynamic and user-friendly programs.
