# IF...THEN...ELSE Statements

## **13.1 Introduction**
The `IF...THEN...ELSE` statement is an extension of the `IF...THEN` construct that allows your program to execute one block of code when a condition is true and a different block when the condition is false. This makes your program more versatile by providing alternative actions based on conditions.

This chapter covers the syntax, usage, and practical examples of `IF...THEN...ELSE` statements in QBasic.

---

## **13.2 What is an `IF...THEN...ELSE` Statement?**
The `IF...THEN...ELSE` statement evaluates a condition. If the condition is true, the program executes the code following `THEN`. If the condition is false, the code after `ELSE` is executed.

### **Syntax**
```basic
IF condition THEN
    [statements if true]
ELSE
    [statements if false]
END IF
```

- **`condition`**: An expression that evaluates to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- **`statements if true`**: Code executed when the condition is true.
- **`statements if false`**: Code executed when the condition is false.

## **13.3 Using `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
### **13.3.1 Example: Basic Usage**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age >= 18 THEN
    PRINT "You are eligible to vote."
ELSE
    PRINT "You are not eligible to vote."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 20):**
```
You are eligible to vote.
```

**Output (if the user enters 15):**
```
You are not eligible to vote.
```

---

### **13.3.2 Example: Dynamic Message**
The `IF...THEN...ELSE` statement can generate dynamic messages based on user input.

```basic
DIM temperature AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter the temperature: ", temperature
IF temperature > 30 THEN
    PRINT "It's a hot day."
ELSE
    PRINT "It's a cool day."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 35):**
```
It's a hot day.
```

**Output (if the user enters 25):**
```
It's a cool day.
```

## **13.4 Using Logical Operators with `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

### **Example: Using `AND`**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your score: ", score
IF score >= 50 AND score <= 100 THEN
    PRINT "You passed the test!"
ELSE
    PRINT "You failed the test."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 75):**
```
You passed the test!
```

**Output (if the user enters 45):**
```
You failed the test.
```

---

### **Example: Using `OR`**
```basic
DIM temperature AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter the temperature: ", temperature
IF temperature < 0 OR temperature > 35 THEN
    PRINT "Extreme weather conditions!"
ELSE
    PRINT "Weather is normal."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters -5):**
```
Extreme weather conditions!
```

**Output (if the user enters 20):**
```
Weather is normal.
```

---

### **Example: Using `NOT`**
```basic
DIM raining AS STRING

INPUT "Is it raining? (yes/no): ", raining
IF NOT raining = "yes" THEN
    PRINT "You can go outside."
ELSE
    PRINT "Better stay indoors."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters "no"):**
```
You can go outside.
```

---

## **13.5 Nested `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
You can include one `IF...THEN...ELSE` statement inside another for complex decision-making.

### **Example: Nested Conditions**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age >= 18 THEN
    IF age >= 65 THEN
        PRINT "You are a senior citizen eligible for additional benefits."
    ELSE
        PRINT "You are an adult."
    END IF
ELSE
    PRINT "You are a minor."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 70):**
```
You are a senior citizen eligible for additional benefits.
```

**Output (if the user enters 25):**
```
You are an adult.
```

**Output (if the user enters 15):**
```
You are a minor.
```

---

## **13.6 Single-Line `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
For simple conditions, you can write the `IF...THEN...ELSE` statement on a single line.

### **Example: Single-Line Usage**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your score: ", score
IF score >= 50 THEN PRINT "Pass" ELSE PRINT "Fail"
```

**Output (if the user enters 60):**
```
Pass
```

**Output (if the user enters 40):**
```
Fail
```

---

## **13.7 Common Errors with `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
1. **Missing `END IF` for Multi-Line Statements**
   - Forgetting `END IF` causes a syntax error.
   - Example (Incorrect):
     ```basic
     IF age >= 18 THEN
         PRINT "Adult"
     ELSE
         PRINT "Minor"
     ```

2. **Incorrect Logical Operators**
   - Writing invalid conditions can lead to logical errors.
   - Example (Incorrect):
     ```basic
     IF age = 18 OR 21 THEN   ' Error: Improper condition
     ```

3. **Unmatched Data Types**
   - Comparing incompatible data types causes errors.
   - Example (Incorrect):
     ```basic
     IF age = "eighteen" THEN  ' Error: Comparing numeric with string
     ```

---

## **13.8 Best Practices for `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
1. **Use Indentation for Readability:**
   - Properly indent the code inside `IF` blocks for clarity.
   ```basic
   IF condition THEN
       PRINT "Condition met"
   ELSE
       PRINT "Condition not met"
   END IF
   ```

2. **Comment Your Code:**
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of conditions.
   ```basic
   IF age >= 18 THEN   ' Check if the user is an adult
   ```

3. **Combine Conditions Wisely:**
   - Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to handle complex scenarios effectively.

4. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure your program handles boundary conditions and unexpected inputs.

---

## **13.9 Summary**
The `IF...THEN...ELSE` statement is a powerful tool for decision-making in QBasic. It allows your program to execute one block of code when a condition is true and another when the condition is false. By mastering nested conditions, logical operators, and proper syntax, you can create programs that adapt dynamically to various scenarios.
