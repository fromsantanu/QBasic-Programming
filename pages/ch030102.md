# **IF...THEN...ELSE Statements**

## **13.1 Introduction**
Decision-making is a crucial part of programming, allowing a program to react differently depending on input or specific conditions. The `IF...THEN...ELSE` statement provides a way to execute one block of code when a condition is true and another block when it is false. For more complex scenarios, QBasic also allows the use of `ELSE IF` to handle multiple conditions sequentially.

This chapter explores the syntax, usage, and applications of `IF...THEN...ELSE` and `IF...ELSE IF...ELSE` statements in QBasic.

## **13.2 What is an `IF...THEN...ELSE` Statement?**
The `IF...THEN...ELSE` statement is a conditional structure that evaluates a condition. If the condition is true, it executes one block of code; otherwise, it executes a different block.

### **Syntax**
```basic
IF condition THEN
    [statements if true]
ELSE
    [statements if false]
END IF
```

- **`condition`**: An expression that evaluates to `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- **`statements if true`**: The code block executed if the condition is true.
- **`statements if false`**: The code block executed if the condition is false.

## **13.3 Using `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
### **13.3.1 Example: Checking Eligibility**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age >= 18 THEN
    PRINT "You are eligible to vote."
ELSE
    PRINT "You are not eligible to vote."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 20):**
```
You are eligible to vote.
```

**Output (if the user enters 16):**
```
You are not eligible to vote.
```

---

## **13.4 Introducing `ELSE IF`**
When multiple conditions need to be checked, you can use the `ELSE IF` construct. This allows you to test several conditions sequentially and execute the corresponding code block for the first condition that evaluates to true.

### **Syntax**
```basic
IF condition1 THEN
    [statements if condition1 is true]
ELSEIF condition2 THEN
    [statements if condition2 is true]
ELSE
    [statements if none of the conditions are true]
END IF
```

- **`condition1`** and **`condition2`**: Logical expressions that evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- **`statements if none of the conditions are true`**: Code executed when all preceding conditions are false.

## **13.5 Using `IF...ELSE IF...ELSE`**
### **Example: Grading System**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your score: ", score
IF score >= 90 THEN
    PRINT "Grade: A"
ELSEIF score >= 75 THEN
    PRINT "Grade: B"
ELSEIF score >= 50 THEN
    PRINT "Grade: C"
ELSE
    PRINT "Grade: F"
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 85):**
```
Grade: B
```

**Output (if the user enters 40):**
```
Grade: F
```

---

### **13.5.2 Example: Categorizing Age Groups**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age < 13 THEN
    PRINT "You are a child."
ELSEIF age >= 13 AND age <= 19 THEN
    PRINT "You are a teenager."
ELSEIF age >= 20 AND age <= 59 THEN
    PRINT "You are an adult."
ELSE
    PRINT "You are a senior citizen."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 16):**
```
You are a teenager.
```

**Output (if the user enters 65):**
```
You are a senior citizen.
```

---

## **13.6 Nested `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
Nested conditions occur when one `IF` statement is placed inside another. This approach is used when additional checks depend on the outcome of an earlier condition.

### **Example: Checking Loan Eligibility**
```basic
DIM income AS INTEGER
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age >= 18 THEN
    INPUT "Enter your income: ", income
    IF income >= 50000 THEN
        PRINT "You are eligible for a loan."
    ELSE
        PRINT "Your income is insufficient for a loan."
    END IF
ELSE
    PRINT "You must be at least 18 years old to apply for a loan."
END IF
```

**Output (if age is 25 and income is 60000):**
```
You are eligible for a loan.
```

**Output (if age is 17):**
```
You must be at least 18 years old to apply for a loan.
```

---

## **13.7 Logical Operators in Conditions**
Logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` can simplify multiple checks in an `IF` statement.

### **Example: Combining Conditions**
```basic
DIM temperature AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter the temperature: ", temperature
IF temperature > 30 AND temperature <= 40 THEN
    PRINT "It's a hot day."
ELSEIF temperature > 40 THEN
    PRINT "It's extremely hot!"
ELSE
    PRINT "The weather is pleasant."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters 35):**
```
It's a hot day.
```

**Output (if the user enters 45):**
```
It's extremely hot!
```

## **13.8 Single-Line `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
For simple conditions, the `IF...THEN...ELSE` construct can be written on a single line.

### **Syntax**
```basic
IF condition THEN statement1 ELSE statement2
```

### **Example**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age >= 18 THEN PRINT "Adult" ELSE PRINT "Minor"
```

**Output (if the user enters 15):**
```
Minor
```

**Output (if the user enters 20):**
```
Adult
```

## **13.9 Common Errors with `IF...THEN...ELSE`**
1. **Missing `END IF`:**
   Forgetting to close the `IF` block causes a syntax error.
   ```basic
   IF score >= 50 THEN
       PRINT "Passed"
   ELSE
       PRINT "Failed"
   ' Missing END IF here
   ```

2. **Misaligned Conditions:**
   Writing conditions in the wrong sequence may produce incorrect results.
   ```basic
   IF score >= 50 THEN
       PRINT "Passed"
   ELSEIF score >= 90 THEN   ' This will never execute
   ```

3. **Unnecessary Nesting:**
   Avoid redundant nested conditions; use `ELSE IF` where possible.

---

## **13.10 Best Practices**
1. **Use Descriptive Conditions:**
   Clearly define the purpose of each condition.
   ```basic
   IF temperature > 30 AND temperature <= 40 THEN
   ```

2. **Comment Complex Logic:**
   Add comments to explain the purpose of conditions.
   ```basic
   IF score >= 90 THEN   ' Check for Grade A
   ```

3. **Minimize Nesting:**
   Simplify logic with `ELSE IF` to reduce the need for deeply nested conditions.

4. **Use Logical Operators:**
   Combine related conditions with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` for clarity.
   ```basic
   IF age >= 18 AND income >= 50000 THEN
   ```

5. **Test Edge Cases:**
   Ensure your conditions handle all possible inputs.

## **13.11 Summary**
The `IF...THEN...ELSE` and `IF...ELSE IF...ELSE` constructs provide powerful tools for decision-making in QBasic. They allow programs to evaluate multiple conditions and execute the appropriate code based on the results. By understanding their syntax, usage, and combining them with logical operators, you can create robust and dynamic programs.
