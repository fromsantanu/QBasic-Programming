# Extracting Substrings (MID$, LEFT$, RIGHT$)

## **24.1 Introduction**
Extracting specific parts of a string, also known as **substring extraction**, is a fundamental operation in text processing. In QBasic, you can extract substrings using the built-in functions `MID$`, `LEFT$`, and `RIGHT$`. These functions allow you to retrieve parts of a string based on their position and length.

This chapter explores the syntax, usage, and applications of these substring functions in QBasic.

## **24.2 Substring Extraction Functions**

### **24.2.1 MID$**
The `MID$` function extracts a substring from the middle (or any position) of a string.

#### **Syntax**
```basic
result = MID$(string, start, length)
```

- **`string`**: The source string.
- **`start`**: The position to start extracting (1-based index).
- **`length`**: (Optional) The number of characters to extract. If omitted, the function extracts from the start position to the end of the string.

---

### **24.2.2 LEFT$**
The `LEFT$` function extracts a specified number of characters from the beginning of a string.

#### **Syntax**
```basic
result = LEFT$(string, n)
```

- **`string`**: The source string.
- **`n`**: The number of characters to extract.

---

### **24.2.3 RIGHT$**
The `RIGHT$` function extracts a specified number of characters from the end of a string.

#### **Syntax**
```basic
result = RIGHT$(string, n)
```

- **`string`**: The source string.
- **`n`**: The number of characters to extract.

## **24.3 Examples of Substring Extraction**

### **24.3.1 Extracting Using `MID$`**
#### **Example 1: Extracting a Word from the Middle**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Welcome to QBasic"

PRINT MID$(text, 9, 2)  ' Output: to
```

#### **Example 2: Extracting Without Length**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Programming"

PRINT MID$(text, 4)  ' Output: gramming
```

---

### **24.3.2 Extracting Using `LEFT$`**
#### **Example 1: Extracting Initials**
```basic
DIM name AS STRING
name = "John Doe"

PRINT LEFT$(name, 4)  ' Output: John
```

#### **Example 2: Extracting a Prefix**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "QBasic Programming"

PRINT LEFT$(text, 6)  ' Output: QBasic
```

---

### **24.3.3 Extracting Using `RIGHT$**
#### **Example 1: Extracting File Extensions**
```basic
DIM fileName AS STRING
fileName = "document.txt"

PRINT RIGHT$(fileName, 3)  ' Output: txt
```

#### **Example 2: Extracting Last Few Characters**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Hello, World!"

PRINT RIGHT$(text, 6)  ' Output: World!
```

---

## **24.4 Applications of Substring Extraction**

### **24.4.1 Extracting Initials**
Use `LEFT$` and `MID$` to extract initials from a full name.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM fullName AS STRING
DIM initials AS STRING

fullName = "John Michael Doe"
initials = LEFT$(fullName, 1) + "." + MID$(fullName, 6, 1) + "." + MID$(fullName, 14, 1) + "."
PRINT "Initials: "; initials
```

**Output:**
```
Initials: J.M.D.
```

---

### **24.4.2 Extracting Area Codes from Phone Numbers**
Use `LEFT$` to extract the area code from a phone number.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM phoneNumber AS STRING
phoneNumber = "(123) 456-7890"

PRINT "Area Code: "; MID$(phoneNumber, 2, 3)
```

**Output:**
```
Area Code: 123
```

---

### **24.4.3 Formatting Dates**
Use `LEFT$`, `MID$`, and `RIGHT$` to format dates.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM date AS STRING
date = "20241208"  ' Format: YYYYMMDD

PRINT "Formatted Date: " + LEFT$(date, 4) + "-" + MID$(date, 5, 2) + "-" + RIGHT$(date, 2)
```

**Output:**
```
Formatted Date: 2024-12-08
```

---

### **24.4.4 Masking Sensitive Data**
Combine `LEFT$` and `RIGHT$` to mask parts of sensitive data, such as credit card numbers.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM cardNumber AS STRING
cardNumber = "1234567890123456"

PRINT "Masked Card: " + LEFT$(cardNumber, 4) + "********" + RIGHT$(cardNumber, 4)
```

**Output:**
```
Masked Card: 1234********3456
```

---

## **24.5 Using Substrings in Loops**
You can iterate through a string and extract substrings dynamically.

### **Example: Splitting Words**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
DIM i AS INTEGER
text = "QBasic Programming Language"

FOR i = 1 TO LEN(text) STEP 8
    PRINT MID$(text, i, 8)
NEXT i
```

**Output:**
```
QBasic P
rogrammi
ng Lang
```

## **24.6 Common Errors with Substrings**
1. **Out-of-Bounds Index:**
   - Ensure the `start` position and `length` are valid.
   ```basic
   PRINT MID$("Hello", 10)  ' Error: Start index exceeds string length
   ```

2. **Negative or Zero Lengths:**
   - Length must be a positive integer.
   ```basic
   PRINT LEFT$("Hello", -3)  ' Error
   ```

3. **Empty Strings:**
   - Using substring functions on empty strings returns an empty result.

---

## **24.7 Best Practices**
1. **Validate String Lengths:**
   - Use the `LEN` function to check if the string is long enough for slicing.
   ```basic
   IF LEN(text) >= 4 THEN
       PRINT MID$(text, 4, 3)
   END IF
   ```

2. **Comment Complex Logic:**
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of substring operations.
   ```basic
   ' Extract the year from the date string
   ```

3. **Handle Special Cases:**
   - Ensure your code accounts for edge cases, such as empty strings or missing characters.

4. **Use Meaningful Variable Names:**
   - Choose descriptive names for variables storing substrings.
   ```basic
   DIM fileExtension AS STRING
   ```

## **24.8 Summary**
Substring extraction with `MID$`, `LEFT$`, and `RIGHT$` is a powerful feature for manipulating text in QBasic. These functions allow you to isolate specific parts of a string, enabling tasks like formatting, masking, and parsing text. By understanding their syntax and applications, you can handle complex string operations effectively in your programs.
