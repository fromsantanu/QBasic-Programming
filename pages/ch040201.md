# Concatenation and Slicing Strings

## **22.1 Introduction**
Strings are a versatile data type in QBasic, often requiring operations such as combining (concatenation) or extracting specific parts (slicing). These operations are essential for processing text and creating dynamic outputs. In this chapter, we will explore how to concatenate and slice strings effectively using QBasic functions and techniques.

---

## **22.2 Concatenating Strings**
**Concatenation** is the process of joining two or more strings into one. In QBasic, the `+` operator is used for this purpose.

### **22.2.1 Syntax**
```basic
result = string1 + string2
```

- **`string1`** and **`string2`**: The strings to combine.
- **`result`**: The resulting concatenated string.

---

### **22.2.2 Examples of Concatenation**
#### **Example 1: Simple Concatenation**
```basic
DIM firstName AS STRING
DIM lastName AS STRING
DIM fullName AS STRING

firstName = "John"
lastName = "Doe"
fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

PRINT "Full Name: "; fullName
```

**Output:**
```
Full Name: John Doe
```

#### **Example 2: Combining Strings and Numbers**
Before concatenating numbers with strings, convert the number to a string using the `STR$` function.
```basic
DIM product AS STRING
DIM price AS SINGLE

product = "Notebook"
price = 12.99

PRINT "The price of " + product + " is $" + STR$(price)
```

**Output:**
```
The price of Notebook is $12.99
```

---

### **22.2.3 Using Concatenation for Dynamic Messages**
Concatenation can create dynamic, personalized messages.

#### **Example: Personalized Greeting**
```basic
DIM userName AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your name: ", userName
PRINT "Hello, " + userName + "! Welcome to QBasic."
```

**Output (if the user enters "Alice"):**
```
Hello, Alice! Welcome to QBasic.
```

## **22.3 Slicing Strings**
**Slicing** involves extracting specific parts of a string, such as the first few characters, a portion from the middle, or characters at the end. QBasic provides built-in functions for slicing strings:

### **22.3.1 Slicing Functions**
1. **`LEFT$`**: Extracts characters from the start of a string.
2. **`RIGHT$`**: Extracts characters from the end of a string.
3. **`MID$`**: Extracts characters from any position within a string.

---

### **22.3.2 Using the `LEFT$` Function**
Extracts a specified number of characters from the beginning of a string.

#### **Syntax**
```basic
result = LEFT$(string, n)
```

- **`string`**: The source string.
- **`n`**: The number of characters to extract.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Programming"

PRINT LEFT$(text, 4)  ' Output: Prog
```

---

### **22.3.3 Using the `RIGHT$` Function**
Extracts a specified number of characters from the end of a string.

#### **Syntax**
```basic
result = RIGHT$(string, n)
```

- **`string`**: The source string.
- **`n`**: The number of characters to extract.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Programming"

PRINT RIGHT$(text, 3)  ' Output: ing
```

---

### **22.3.4 Using the `MID$` Function**
Extracts a substring starting at a specific position and optionally for a specified length.

#### **Syntax**
```basic
result = MID$(string, start, length)
```

- **`string`**: The source string.
- **`start`**: The position to start extraction (1-based index).
- **`length`**: (Optional) The number of characters to extract.

#### **Examples**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Programming"

PRINT MID$(text, 4, 3)  ' Output: gra
PRINT MID$(text, 4)     ' Output: gramming
```

---

## **22.4 Combining Concatenation and Slicing**
You can combine both operations to create customized strings.

### **Example: Masking Sensitive Data**
```basic
DIM cardNumber AS STRING
cardNumber = "1234567890123456"

PRINT "Masked Card: " + LEFT$(cardNumber, 4) + "********" + RIGHT$(cardNumber, 4)
```

**Output:**
```
Masked Card: 1234********3456
```

---

## **22.5 Practical Applications of Concatenation and Slicing**

### **22.5.1 Initials from Full Names**
```basic
DIM fullName AS STRING
DIM initials AS STRING

fullName = "John Doe"
initials = LEFT$(fullName, 1) + "." + MID$(fullName, INSTR(fullName, " ") + 1, 1) + "."
PRINT "Initials: "; initials
```

**Output:**
```
Initials: J.D.
```

---

### **22.5.2 Extracting File Extensions**
```basic
DIM fileName AS STRING
fileName = "document.txt"

PRINT "File Extension: " + RIGHT$(fileName, LEN(fileName) - INSTR(fileName, "."))
```

**Output:**
```
File Extension: txt
```

---

### **22.5.3 Formatting Dates**
```basic
DIM date AS STRING
date = "20240101"  ' Format: YYYYMMDD

PRINT "Formatted Date: " + LEFT$(date, 4) + "-" + MID$(date, 5, 2) + "-" + RIGHT$(date, 2)
```

**Output:**
```
Formatted Date: 2024-01-01
```

---

## **22.6 Common Errors with Concatenation and Slicing**
1. **Out-of-Bounds Index in Slicing:**
   - Ensure the length specified in slicing functions is within the string's range.
   ```basic
   PRINT MID$("Hello", 10)  ' Error: Start index exceeds string length
   ```

2. **Concatenating Strings and Numbers Without Conversion:**
   - Convert numbers to strings using `STR$` before concatenating.
   ```basic
   PRINT "Age: " + 25  ' Error
   PRINT "Age: " + STR$(25)  ' Correct
   ```

3. **Using Uninitialized Strings:**
   - Always initialize string variables before operations to avoid unexpected behavior.

---

## **22.7 Best Practices**
1. **Use Meaningful Variable Names:**
   - Name variables clearly to reflect their purpose.
   ```basic
   DIM userName AS STRING
   DIM maskedCard AS STRING
   ```

2. **Validate String Lengths:**
   - Before slicing, ensure the length of the string is sufficient.
   ```basic
   IF LEN(text) >= 3 THEN
       PRINT LEFT$(text, 3)
   END IF
   ```

3. **Avoid Redundant Concatenation:**
   - Use concatenation only when necessary for better readability.

4. **Use Comments for Complex Operations:**
   - Explain the purpose of slicing and concatenation in comments.
   ```basic
   ' Extract first 4 digits and mask the rest
   ```

---

## **22.8 Summary**
String concatenation and slicing are fundamental operations in QBasic that allow you to manipulate text dynamically. Concatenation combines strings, while slicing extracts specific parts of a string using functions like `LEFT$`, `RIGHT$`, and `MID$`. These tools are essential for tasks like formatting data, generating dynamic outputs, and processing text inputs. Mastering these techniques will significantly enhance your programming capabilities.
