# The `WHILE...WEND` Loop

## **15.1 Introduction**
The `WHILE...WEND` loop is a control structure in QBasic used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. Unlike the `FOR...NEXT` loop, the `WHILE...WEND` loop is condition-based and does not require a fixed number of iterations, making it ideal for scenarios where the number of repetitions is determined dynamically during program execution.

This chapter explains the syntax, usage, examples, and best practices for using the `WHILE...WEND` loop.

## **15.2 What is a `WHILE...WEND` Loop?**
The `WHILE...WEND` loop checks a condition before executing its block of code. If the condition is true, the loop body runs; otherwise, the loop ends. This allows the loop to continue until the condition becomes false.

### **Syntax**
```basic
WHILE condition
    [statements]
WEND
```

- **`condition`**: A logical expression that evaluates to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- **`statements`**: The block of code to execute while the condition is true.

## **15.3 Using the `WHILE...WEND` Loop**
### **15.3.1 Basic Loop Example**
```basic
DIM counter AS INTEGER
counter = 1

WHILE counter <= 5
    PRINT "Counter: "; counter
    counter = counter + 1
WEND
```

**Output:**
```
Counter: 1
Counter: 2
Counter: 3
Counter: 4
Counter: 5
```

### **15.3.2 Loop with User Input**
The `WHILE...WEND` loop can be used to repeat tasks based on user input.

#### Example: Taking User Input Until a Condition is Met
```basic
DIM number AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter a positive number (or 0 to stop): ", number
WHILE number > 0
    PRINT "You entered: "; number
    INPUT "Enter another number (or 0 to stop): ", number
WEND
PRINT "Loop ended."
```

**Output (if the user enters 5, 10, and 0):**
```
Enter a positive number (or 0 to stop): 5
You entered: 5
Enter another number (or 0 to stop): 10
You entered: 10
Enter another number (or 0 to stop): 0
Loop ended.
```

---

## **15.4 Infinite Loops**
A `WHILE...WEND` loop can result in an infinite loop if the condition never becomes false. Use this carefully and include an exit condition within the loop.

### **Example: Avoiding an Infinite Loop**
```basic
DIM i AS INTEGER
i = 1

WHILE i <= 10
    PRINT "Iteration: "; i
    i = i + 1
WEND
```

---

## **15.5 Using Logical Operators in Conditions**
You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to control the loop execution.

### **Example: Using `AND`**
```basic
DIM num AS INTEGER
num = 1

WHILE num > 0 AND num <= 10
    PRINT "Number: "; num
    num = num + 1
WEND
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
...
Number: 10
```

---

### **Example: Using `OR`**
```basic
DIM choice AS STRING
choice = "y"

WHILE choice = "y" OR choice = "Y"
    PRINT "Repeating the task."
    INPUT "Do you want to continue? (y/n): ", choice
WEND
```

**Output (if the user enters "y" twice, then "n"):**
```
Repeating the task.
Do you want to continue? (y/n): y
Repeating the task.
Do you want to continue? (y/n): n
```

---

## **15.6 Nested `WHILE...WEND` Loops**
You can nest one `WHILE...WEND` loop inside another to handle multidimensional scenarios.

### **Example: Generating a Number Grid**
```basic
DIM i AS INTEGER
DIM j AS INTEGER

i = 1
WHILE i <= 3
    j = 1
    WHILE j <= 3
        PRINT "(", i, ", ", j, ") ";
        j = j + 1
    WEND
    PRINT   ' Add a new line for each row
    i = i + 1
WEND
```

**Output:**
```
(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) 
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) 
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3)
```

---

## **15.7 Using `EXIT` to Break Out of a Loop**
The `EXIT WHILE` statement allows you to terminate a `WHILE...WEND` loop prematurely when a specific condition is met.

### **Example: Breaking a Loop**
```basic
DIM num AS INTEGER
num = 1

WHILE num <= 10
    PRINT "Number: "; num
    IF num = 5 THEN
        PRINT "Breaking the loop."
        EXIT WHILE
    END IF
    num = num + 1
WEND
PRINT "Loop ended."
```

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
Breaking the loop.
Loop ended.
```

## **15.8 Common Errors with `WHILE...WEND` Loops**
1. **Infinite Loop:**
   - Forgetting to update the loop condition can cause an infinite loop.
   ```basic
   WHILE i <= 5
       PRINT i
       ' Missing i = i + 1
   WEND
   ```

2. **Uninitialized Condition Variable:**
   - Using a variable in the condition without initializing it can result in unpredictable behavior.
   ```basic
   WHILE num > 0
       PRINT num
   WEND
   ```

3. **Incorrect Logical Conditions:**
   - Writing invalid or contradictory conditions can prevent the loop from executing correctly.
   ```basic
   WHILE num > 10 AND num < 5
       PRINT num
   WEND
   ```

## **15.9 Applications of `WHILE...WEND` Loops**
### **15.9.1 Validating User Input**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your score (0-100): ", score
WHILE score < 0 OR score > 100
    PRINT "Invalid score. Try again."
    INPUT "Enter your score (0-100): ", score
WEND
PRINT "Your score is "; score
```

### **15.9.2 Calculating Factorials**
```basic
DIM n AS INTEGER
DIM factorial AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter a number: ", n
factorial = 1
WHILE n > 0
    factorial = factorial * n
    n = n - 1
WEND
PRINT "The factorial is "; factorial
```

---

## **15.10 Best Practices for `WHILE...WEND` Loops**
1. **Ensure a Proper Exit Condition:**
   - Always update variables in the loop to prevent infinite loops.

2. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Name variables clearly to indicate their purpose.
   ```basic
   WHILE remainingTime > 0
   ```

3. **Comment Your Code:**
   - Add comments to explain the loopâ€™s purpose and logic.
   ```basic
   ' Repeat until the user enters "n"
   ```

4. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure the loop behaves correctly for boundary conditions.

---

## **15.11 Summary**
The `WHILE...WEND` loop is a flexible control structure for executing code repeatedly based on a condition. By understanding its syntax, nested usage, and exit mechanisms, you can create dynamic and interactive programs. Always validate conditions and use meaningful variable names to enhance the readability and reliability of your loops.
