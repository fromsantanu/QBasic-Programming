# Chapter 38: Creating a Small Student Record System

## **38.1 Introduction**
A student record system allows you to manage and store student details efficiently. In this chapter, we will build a small student record system in QBasic. This program will include features for adding, viewing, and searching student records, as well as saving and retrieving data from a file.

---

## **38.2 Features of the Student Record System**

1. **Add Student Records**: Enter and store student information, such as name, roll number, and marks.
2. **View All Records**: Display all stored student records.
3. **Search for a Student**: Retrieve a specific studentâ€™s details using their roll number.
4. **Store Data in a File**: Save records to a file for future retrieval.
5. **Retrieve Data from a File**: Load records from a file when the program starts.

---

## **38.3 Design of the System**

The system will use:
- **Arrays** to temporarily hold student data.
- **File Handling** to store data persistently.
- **Subroutines** to organize functionality into logical sections.

## **38.4 Code for the Student Record System**

### **Program Code**
```basic
DIM names$(100), rollNos(100) AS INTEGER, marks(100) AS SINGLE
DIM studentCount AS INTEGER
studentCount = 0

CALL LoadRecords

DO
    PRINT "Student Record System"
    PRINT "1. Add Student"
    PRINT "2. View All Students"
    PRINT "3. Search for a Student"
    PRINT "4. Save and Exit"
    INPUT "Enter your choice: ", choice

    SELECT CASE choice
        CASE 1
            CALL AddStudent
        CASE 2
            CALL ViewStudents
        CASE 3
            CALL SearchStudent
        CASE 4
            CALL SaveRecords
            PRINT "Records saved. Exiting..."
            EXIT DO
        CASE ELSE
            PRINT "Invalid choice! Please try again."
    END SELECT
LOOP

END

' Subroutine to Add a New Student
SUB AddStudent
    studentCount = studentCount + 1
    INPUT "Enter student name: ", names$(studentCount)
    INPUT "Enter roll number: ", rollNos(studentCount)
    INPUT "Enter marks: ", marks(studentCount)
    PRINT "Student record added successfully!"
END SUB

' Subroutine to View All Students
SUB ViewStudents
    IF studentCount = 0 THEN
        PRINT "No student records available."
    ELSE
        PRINT "Roll No", "Name", "Marks"
        FOR i = 1 TO studentCount
            PRINT rollNos(i), names$(i), marks(i)
        NEXT i
    END IF
END SUB

' Subroutine to Search for a Student by Roll Number
SUB SearchStudent
    INPUT "Enter roll number to search: ", searchRoll
    found = 0
    FOR i = 1 TO studentCount
        IF rollNos(i) = searchRoll THEN
            PRINT "Student Found:"
            PRINT "Name: "; names$(i)
            PRINT "Roll No: "; rollNos(i)
            PRINT "Marks: "; marks(i)
            found = 1
            EXIT FOR
        END IF
    NEXT i
    IF found = 0 THEN
        PRINT "Student with roll number "; searchRoll; " not found."
    END IF
END SUB

' Subroutine to Save Records to a File
SUB SaveRecords
    OPEN "students.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
    FOR i = 1 TO studentCount
        PRINT #1, names$(i); ","; rollNos(i); ","; marks(i)
    NEXT i
    CLOSE #1
    PRINT "All records saved to file."
END SUB

' Subroutine to Load Records from a File
SUB LoadRecords
    IF FILEATTR("students.txt", 1) = 0 THEN
        PRINT "No existing records found. Starting fresh."
        EXIT SUB
    END IF

    OPEN "students.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1
    DO WHILE NOT EOF(1)
        studentCount = studentCount + 1
        INPUT #1, record$
        record$ = record$ + ","
        names$(studentCount) = MID$(record$, 1, INSTR(record$, ",") - 1)
        record$ = MID$(record$, INSTR(record$, ",") + 1)
        rollNos(studentCount) = VAL(MID$(record$, 1, INSTR(record$, ",") - 1))
        record$ = MID$(record$, INSTR(record$, ",") + 1)
        marks(studentCount) = VAL(record$)
    LOOP
    CLOSE #1
    PRINT "Records loaded from file."
END SUB
```

## **38.5 Explanation of the Code**

### **Adding Student Records**
- User inputs student details: name, roll number, and marks.
- Data is stored in arrays: `names$`, `rollNos`, and `marks`.

### **Viewing All Records**
- Displays all stored records with column headings.
- Uses a loop to iterate through the arrays.

### **Searching for a Student**
- Prompts the user to input a roll number.
- Searches for the roll number in the `rollNos` array.
- Displays the corresponding student details if found.

### **Saving Records to a File**
- Opens `students.txt` in `OUTPUT` mode.
- Writes each student record in a comma-separated format.
- Closes the file after writing.

### **Loading Records from a File**
- Opens `students.txt` in `INPUT` mode.
- Reads each record, splits it using commas, and stores the data in the arrays.
- Updates `studentCount` to reflect the number of records loaded.

## **38.6 Example Interaction**

### **Input**
```
1. Add Student
2. View All Students
3. Search for a Student
4. Save and Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter student name: Alice
Enter roll number: 101
Enter marks: 85
Enter your choice: 2
Enter your choice: 3
Enter roll number to search: 101
Enter your choice: 4
```

### **Output**
```
Student Record System
1. Add Student
2. View All Students
3. Search for a Student
4. Save and Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter student name: Alice
Enter roll number: 101
Enter marks: 85
Student record added successfully!
Enter your choice: 2
Roll No      Name            Marks
101          Alice           85
Enter your choice: 3
Enter roll number to search: 101
Student Found:
Name: Alice
Roll No: 101
Marks: 85
Enter your choice: 4
All records saved to file.
Records saved. Exiting...
```

## **38.7 Best Practices**

1. **Validate User Input:**
   - Ensure roll numbers and marks are valid before storing them.

2. **Handle File Errors:**
   - Check if the file exists before loading records.

3. **Use Modular Subroutines:**
   - Keep subroutines focused on specific tasks for better readability and maintainability.

4. **Backup Files:**
   - Periodically back up `students.txt` to avoid accidental data loss.

## **38.8 Summary**
This small student record system demonstrates how to create, view, search, and manage student data in QBasic. By combining arrays, file handling, and modular subroutines, the program provides a scalable and efficient solution for basic data management. With some modifications, this system can be extended to include more features like editing and deleting records.
