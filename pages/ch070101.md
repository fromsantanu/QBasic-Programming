# Opening, Reading, and Writing Text Files

## **36.1 Introduction**
File handling is an essential part of programming that allows you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data outside of your program. In QBasic, you can work with text files to save information permanently, read existing data, or update it. This chapter explains how to open, read, and write text files using QBasic.

## **36.2 File Handling Basics in QBasic**
QBasic provides the following modes for handling files:
1. **Input Mode**: Used for reading data from a file.
2. **Output Mode**: Used for writing new data to a file (overwrites existing data).
3. **Append Mode**: Used for adding data to the end of a file without erasing its contents.

### **Commands for File Handling**
- `OPEN`: Opens a file in a specified mode.
- `CLOSE`: Closes the opened file.
- `PRINT #`: Writes data to a file.
- `INPUT #`: Reads data from a file.
- `LINE INPUT #`: Reads an entire line from a file.

---

## **36.3 Opening a File**
The `OPEN` command is used to open a file in the desired mode.

### **Syntax**
```basic
OPEN "filename" FOR mode AS #fileNumber
```

- **`filename`**: The name of the file.
- **`mode`**: The file mode (`INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, or `APPEND`).
- **`fileNumber`**: A unique identifier (1-255) for the file.

## **36.4 Writing to a Text File**
When writing to a file, use the `OUTPUT` or `APPEND` mode.

### **36.4.1 Example: Writing New Data**
```basic
OPEN "data.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
PRINT #1, "Hello, World!"
PRINT #1, "Welcome to QBasic File Handling"
CLOSE #1
```

**Explanation:**
- Opens the file `data.txt` in `OUTPUT` mode (creates the file if it doesnâ€™t exist).
- Writes two lines of text to the file.
- Closes the file.

**Output in `data.txt`:**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to QBasic File Handling
```

---

### **36.4.2 Example: Appending Data**
```basic
OPEN "data.txt" FOR APPEND AS #1
PRINT #1, "This line is appended to the file."
CLOSE #1
```

**Explanation:**
- Opens the file `data.txt` in `APPEND` mode.
- Adds a new line without overwriting existing content.
- Closes the file.

**Updated `data.txt`:**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to QBasic File Handling
This line is appended to the file.
```

---

## **36.5 Reading from a Text File**
When reading a file, use the `INPUT` mode. You can read line-by-line using `LINE INPUT #` or read specific data using `INPUT #`.

### **36.5.1 Example: Reading Line by Line**
```basic
OPEN "data.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1
DO WHILE NOT EOF(1)  ' Loops until the end of the file
    LINE INPUT #1, line$
    PRINT line$
LOOP
CLOSE #1
```

**Explanation:**
- Opens `data.txt` in `INPUT` mode.
- Reads each line and stores it in `line$`.
- Prints the line to the screen.
- Loops until the end of the file.

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to QBasic File Handling
This line is appended to the file.
```

---

### **36.5.2 Example: Reading Specific Data**
```basic
OPEN "data.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1
DO WHILE NOT EOF(1)
    INPUT #1, data$
    PRINT data$
LOOP
CLOSE #1
```

**Explanation:**
- Uses `INPUT #` to read specific data (assumes comma-separated values or single-line data).
- Prints the data to the screen.

---

## **36.6 Combining Reading and Writing**

### **Example: Copying File Content**
This example demonstrates how to read data from one file and write it to another.
```basic
OPEN "data.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1
OPEN "copy.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #2

DO WHILE NOT EOF(1)
    LINE INPUT #1, line$
    PRINT #2, line$
LOOP

CLOSE #1
CLOSE #2
```

**Explanation:**
- Opens `data.txt` for reading and `copy.txt` for writing.
- Reads each line from `data.txt` and writes it to `copy.txt`.
- Closes both files.

---

## **36.7 Deleting a File**
QBasic does not have a direct command to delete a file. However, you can use system commands like `KILL`.

### **Syntax**
```basic
KILL "filename"
```

**Example:**
```basic
KILL "data.txt"
```

**Explanation:**
- Deletes the file `data.txt` if it exists.

---

## **36.8 Common Errors in File Handling**

1. **File Not Found:**
   - Occurs when trying to open a non-existent file in `INPUT` mode.
   ```basic
   OPEN "nonexistent.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1
   ' Error: File not found
   ```

2. **File Already Open:**
   - Ensure the file is closed before reopening it.

3. **Invalid File Number:**
   - Use a valid file number between 1 and 255.

---

## **36.9 Best Practices for File Handling**

1. **Always Close Files:**
   - Use `CLOSE` after completing file operations to free system resources.

2. **Check File Existence:**
   - Verify the existence of a file using `FILEATTR` or handle errors gracefully.

3. **Use Unique File Numbers:**
   - Assign unique numbers to each open file.

4. **Backup Important Files:**
   - When overwriting a file, consider creating a backup.

---

## **36.10 Summary**
File handling in QBasic allows you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in text files. Using the `OPEN`, `PRINT #`, `INPUT #`, and `CLOSE` commands, you can perform tasks like reading, writing, and appending data. Understanding these operations is essential for creating programs that interact with external data efficiently.
