# Simple Animations

## **41.1 Introduction**
Animations are a sequence of images or graphics displayed in rapid succession to create the illusion of movement. In QBasic, animations can be created by updating graphics in a loop and adding delays to control the speed of movement. This chapter explores how to create simple animations using graphical commands and loops.

---

## **41.2 Key Concepts for Animations**

### **1. Loops**
Loops are used to continuously update the position of graphics on the screen.

### **2. Delays**
The `SLEEP` or `FOR...NEXT` loops can introduce delays between updates to control animation speed.

### **3. Clearing the Screen**
Use the `CLS` command to clear the screen before redrawing graphics to create a smooth animation.

### **4. Dynamic Coordinates**
Change the coordinates of shapes incrementally to simulate motion.

---

## **41.3 Setting Up Graphics Mode**
Before starting any animation, set the screen to graphics mode.

```basic
SCREEN 12
```

## **41.4 Examples of Simple Animations**

### **41.4.1 Moving a Point**
This example shows a point moving across the screen.

```basic
SCREEN 12

FOR x = 0 TO 640 STEP 10
    CLS
    PSET (x, 200), 14  ' Plot a yellow point
    SLEEP 1            ' Pause for 1 second
NEXT x
```

**Explanation:**
- A yellow point moves horizontally across the screen.
- `CLS` clears the screen in each iteration.
- `SLEEP` controls the animation speed.

---

### **41.4.2 Moving a Ball**
This example demonstrates a ball moving in a straight line.

```basic
SCREEN 12

FOR x = 50 TO 600 STEP 10
    CLS
    CIRCLE (x, 200), 20, 4  ' Draw a red ball
    SLEEP 0.1               ' Short delay
NEXT x
```

**Explanation:**
- A red ball moves horizontally from left to right.
- The ball's x-coordinate is updated in each iteration.

---

### **41.4.3 Bouncing Ball**
This example simulates a ball bouncing between the edges of the screen.

```basic
SCREEN 12

x = 320
y = 240
dx = 5
dy = 3

DO
    CLS
    CIRCLE (x, y), 20, 14  ' Draw a yellow ball
    x = x + dx
    y = y + dy

    ' Reverse direction if the ball hits the edges
    IF x >= 620 OR x <= 20 THEN dx = -dx
    IF y >= 460 OR y <= 20 THEN dy = -dy

    SLEEP 0.02
LOOP
```

**Explanation:**
- The ball moves diagonally and changes direction upon hitting screen edges.
- `dx` and `dy` control the movement in x and y directions.

---

### **41.4.4 Moving a Rectangle**
This example animates a rectangle moving across the screen.

```basic
SCREEN 12

FOR x = 50 TO 600 STEP 20
    CLS
    LINE (x, 200)-(x + 100, 300), 2, BF  ' Draw a green rectangle
    SLEEP 0.1
NEXT x
```

**Explanation:**
- A green rectangle moves horizontally across the screen.
- The rectangle is cleared and redrawn at each position.

---

### **41.4.5 Rotating Line**
This example animates a line rotating around a point.

```basic
SCREEN 12

cx = 320
cy = 240
radius = 100

FOR angle = 0 TO 360 STEP 10
    CLS
    x = cx + radius * COS(angle * 3.14159 / 180)
    y = cy + radius * SIN(angle * 3.14159 / 180)
    LINE (cx, cy)-(x, y), 4  ' Draw a rotating red line
    SLEEP 0.05
NEXT angle
```

**Explanation:**
- A line rotates around the center `(320, 240)`.
- Trigonometric functions are used to calculate the line's endpoint.

## **41.5 Advanced Animations**

### **41.5.1 Simulating a Moving Car**
This example animates a car moving across the screen.

```basic
SCREEN 12

FOR x = 50 TO 600 STEP 10
    CLS
    ' Draw car body
    LINE (x, 300)-(x + 100, 350), 7, BF  ' White body
    LINE (x + 20, 270)-(x + 80, 300), 4, BF  ' Red roof

    ' Draw wheels
    CIRCLE (x + 20, 350), 10, 0  ' Black left wheel
    CIRCLE (x + 80, 350), 10, 0  ' Black right wheel

    SLEEP 0.1
NEXT x
```

**Explanation:**
- A car shape moves horizontally across the screen.
- The car consists of rectangles and circles to represent the body and wheels.

### **41.5.2 Pendulum Swing**
This example simulates a swinging pendulum.

```basic
SCREEN 12

cx = 320
cy = 100
length = 200

FOR angle = -45 TO 45 STEP 5
    CLS
    x = cx + length * SIN(angle * 3.14159 / 180)
    y = cy + length * COS(angle * 3.14159 / 180)

    LINE (cx, cy)-(x, y), 7  ' Pendulum rod
    CIRCLE (x, y), 20, 14    ' Pendulum bob

    SLEEP 0.1
    IF angle = 45 THEN angle = -45
NEXT angle
```

**Explanation:**
- A pendulum swings back and forth.
- Trigonometric functions calculate the pendulumâ€™s position.

### **41.5.3 Expanding and Shrinking Circle**
This example animates a circle that grows and shrinks.

```basic
SCREEN 12

DO
    FOR radius = 10 TO 100 STEP 5
        CLS
        CIRCLE (320, 240), radius, 2  ' Expanding green circle
        SLEEP 0.05
    NEXT radius

    FOR radius = 100 TO 10 STEP -5
        CLS
        CIRCLE (320, 240), radius, 2  ' Shrinking green circle
        SLEEP 0.05
    NEXT radius
LOOP
```

**Explanation:**
- A circle expands and contracts repeatedly.
- The radius is incremented and decremented in a loop.

---

## **41.6 Common Issues in Animations**

1. **Flickering:**
   - Occurs when `CLS` clears the screen too quickly. Use double buffering or optimize redraw frequency.

2. **Performance:**
   - Use small delays (`SLEEP` or `FOR...NEXT`) to balance speed and smoothness.

3. **Out-of-Range Coordinates:**
   - Ensure shapes stay within the screen dimensions.

---

## **41.7 Best Practices for Animations**

1. **Use Modular Code:**
   - Create reusable subroutines for drawing shapes.

2. **Control Speed:**
   - Adjust delay values to ensure smooth animations.

3. **Plan Your Design:**
   - Sketch out the animation flow and calculate coordinates before coding.

4. **Experiment with Colors:**
   - Use different colors to make animations more engaging.

---

## **41.8 Summary**
Creating animations in QBasic involves combining loops, delays, and graphical commands like **PSET**, **LINE**, and **CIRCLE**. By dynamically updating coordinates and redrawing shapes, you can simulate motion and create visually appealing effects. Mastering these techniques opens the door to building simple games, simulations, and interactive graphics.
