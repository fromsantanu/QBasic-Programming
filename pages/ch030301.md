# Nested Conditions

## **17.1 Introduction**
Nested conditions are a programming technique in which one conditional statement is placed inside another. This structure allows you to handle more complex decision-making scenarios by testing multiple related conditions. In QBasic, you can nest `IF...THEN`, `IF...THEN...ELSE`, and other control structures to create logical hierarchies.

This chapter introduces nested conditions, their syntax, examples, and best practices.

## **17.2 What are Nested Conditions?**
Nested conditions occur when an `IF` statement (or other conditional control structure) is placed inside another `IF` statement. The inner condition is only evaluated if the outer condition is true.

### **Syntax**
```basic
IF condition1 THEN
    IF condition2 THEN
        [statements]
    END IF
END IF
```

## **17.3 Using Nested Conditions**

### **17.3.1 Basic Example**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER
DIM hasVoterID AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age >= 18 THEN
    INPUT "Do you have a voter ID? (yes/no): ", hasVoterID
    IF hasVoterID = "yes" THEN
        PRINT "You are eligible to vote."
    ELSE
        PRINT "You need a voter ID to vote."
    END IF
ELSE
    PRINT "You are not eligible to vote."
END IF
```

**Output (if user enters age `20` and `yes` for voter ID):**
```
You are eligible to vote.
```

**Output (if user enters age `16`):**
```
You are not eligible to vote.
```

---

## **17.4 Adding `ELSE` with Nested Conditions**
You can combine nested conditions with `ELSE` clauses for more comprehensive decision-making.

### **Example: Grade Categorization**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER

INPUT "Enter your score: ", score
IF score >= 50 THEN
    IF score >= 90 THEN
        PRINT "Grade: A"
    ELSE
        PRINT "Grade: B"
    END IF
ELSE
    PRINT "Grade: F"
END IF
```

**Output (if user enters `95`):**
```
Grade: A
```

**Output (if user enters `65`):**
```
Grade: B
```

**Output (if user enters `45`):**
```
Grade: F
```

---

## **17.5 Using Logical Operators with Nested Conditions**
Logical operators such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` can simplify nested conditions by combining multiple checks in a single statement.

### **Example: Simplifying Nested Conditions**
Instead of writing nested conditions:
```basic
IF age >= 18 THEN
    IF hasVoterID = "yes" THEN
        PRINT "Eligible to vote."
    END IF
END IF
```

You can write:
```basic
IF age >= 18 AND hasVoterID = "yes" THEN
    PRINT "Eligible to vote."
END IF
```

This approach reduces complexity and improves readability.

## **17.6 Deeply Nested Conditions**
When multiple levels of nesting are required, ensure that each condition serves a specific purpose.

### **Example: Multi-Level Decisions**
```basic
DIM age AS INTEGER
DIM income AS SINGLE

INPUT "Enter your age: ", age
IF age >= 18 THEN
    INPUT "Enter your income: ", income
    IF income >= 50000 THEN
        PRINT "You are eligible for a premium credit card."
    ELSE
        PRINT "You are eligible for a standard credit card."
    END IF
ELSE
    PRINT "You are not eligible for a credit card."
END IF
```

**Output (if user enters age `25` and income `60000`):**
```
You are eligible for a premium credit card.
```

---

## **17.7 Using Nested `IF` with Other Control Structures**
Nested conditions can be combined with loops for scenarios that involve repeated checks.

### **Example: Checking Multiple Students' Grades**
```basic
DIM score AS INTEGER
DIM studentCount AS INTEGER

FOR studentCount = 1 TO 3
    INPUT "Enter score for student "; studentCount; ": ", score
    IF score >= 50 THEN
        IF score >= 90 THEN
            PRINT "Student "; studentCount; ": Grade A"
        ELSE
            PRINT "Student "; studentCount; ": Grade B"
        END IF
    ELSE
        PRINT "Student "; studentCount; ": Grade F"
    END IF
NEXT studentCount
```

**Output (if scores entered are `95`, `65`, and `45`):**
```
Enter score for student 1: 95
Student 1: Grade A
Enter score for student 2: 65
Student 2: Grade B
Enter score for student 3: 45
Student 3: Grade F
```

## **17.8 Common Errors with Nested Conditions**
1. **Misaligned `IF` and `END IF`:**
   - Forgetting to properly align or close `IF` statements can cause syntax errors.
   ```basic
   IF age >= 18 THEN
       IF hasVoterID = "yes" THEN
           PRINT "Eligible"
       ' Missing END IF here
   END IF
   ```

2. **Redundant Conditions:**
   - Avoid writing unnecessary nested conditions that can be combined with logical operators.
   ```basic
   IF a > 5 THEN
       IF a > 10 THEN
   ' Combine as: IF a > 10 THEN
   ```

3. **Over-Nesting:**
   - Excessive levels of nesting can make the code difficult to read and debug. Simplify where possible.

---

## **17.9 Best Practices for Nested Conditions**
1. **Keep Nesting to a Minimum:**
   - Simplify complex conditions using logical operators.
   ```basic
   IF age >= 18 AND hasVoterID = "yes" THEN
   ```

2. **Indent for Readability:**
   - Use proper indentation to distinguish between nested levels.
   ```basic
   IF condition1 THEN
       IF condition2 THEN
           PRINT "Action"
       END IF
   END IF
   ```

3. **Comment Nested Conditions:**
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of each level.
   ```basic
   IF age >= 18 THEN   ' Check if user is an adult
       IF income > 50000 THEN   ' Check income level
   ```

4. **Combine Logical Conditions:**
   - Use `AND` and `OR` to reduce unnecessary nesting.

5. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure all possible conditions are handled correctly.

## **17.10 Summary**
Nested conditions allow you to handle complex decision-making scenarios by evaluating multiple conditions in a hierarchical structure. By mastering the use of nested `IF...THEN`, `IF...THEN...ELSE`, and logical operators, you can write clear and efficient code. Always strive to minimize over-nesting and maintain readability through proper formatting and comments.
