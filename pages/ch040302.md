# Searching Within Strings (INSTR Function)

## **26.1 Introduction**
The `INSTR` function in QBasic is used to search for the position of a substring within a string. It is a powerful tool for text processing tasks such as finding keywords, validating input, or extracting specific information. This chapter explains the syntax, usage, and practical applications of the `INSTR` function.

## **26.2 What is the `INSTR` Function?**

### **26.2.1 Purpose**
The `INSTR` function searches for a substring in a given string and returns the position (1-based index) of its first occurrence. If the substring is not found, it returns `0`.

---

## **26.3 Syntax**
```basic
position = INSTR([start], string, substring)
```

- **`start`** *(optional)*: The position in the string to start the search (default is 1).
- **`string`**: The string to search within.
- **`substring`**: The substring to find.
- **`position`**: The index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. Returns `0` if not found.

---

## **26.4 Examples of Using `INSTR`**

### **26.4.1 Basic Usage**
#### **Example: Finding a Substring**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Learning QBasic is fun!"

PRINT "Position of 'QBasic': "; INSTR(text, "QBasic")
```

**Output:**
```
Position of 'QBasic': 10
```

---

### **26.4.2 Case-Sensitive Search**
The `INSTR` function is case-sensitive, meaning "qbasic" and "QBasic" are treated differently.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Learning QBasic is fun!"

PRINT "Position of 'qbasic': "; INSTR(text, "qbasic")
```

**Output:**
```
Position of 'qbasic': 0
```

To perform a case-insensitive search, convert both strings to the same case using `UCASE$` or `LCASE$`.

#### **Example: Case-Insensitive Search**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Learning QBasic is fun!"

PRINT "Position of 'qbasic': "; INSTR(UCASE$(text), UCASE$("qbasic"))
```

**Output:**
```
Position of 'qbasic': 10
```

---

### **26.4.3 Specifying a Starting Position**
You can start the search from a specific position in the string.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "Learning QBasic and enjoying QBasic!"

PRINT "First occurrence of 'QBasic': "; INSTR(text, "QBasic")
PRINT "Second occurrence of 'QBasic': "; INSTR(11, text, "QBasic")
```

**Output:**
```
First occurrence of 'QBasic': 10
Second occurrence of 'QBasic': 27
```

---

## **26.5 Applications of `INSTR`**

### **26.5.1 Searching for Keywords**
You can use `INSTR` to check if a keyword exists in a string.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

IF INSTR(text, "fox") > 0 THEN
    PRINT "'fox' found in the text."
ELSE
    PRINT "'fox' not found in the text."
END IF
```

**Output:**
```
'fox' found in the text.
```

---

### **26.5.2 Extracting Substrings Using `INSTR`**
Combine `INSTR` with `MID$` to extract parts of a string dynamically.

#### **Example: Extracting a Domain from an Email Address**
```basic
DIM email AS STRING
DIM atPosition AS INTEGER
DIM domain AS STRING

email = "user@example.com"
atPosition = INSTR(email, "@")
domain = MID$(email, atPosition + 1)

PRINT "Email domain: "; domain
```

**Output:**
```
Email domain: example.com
```

---

### **26.5.3 Validating Input**
Use `INSTR` to check if a string contains specific required elements, such as "@" in an email address.

#### **Example: Email Validation**
```basic
DIM email AS STRING

INPUT "Enter your email: ", email
IF INSTR(email, "@") > 0 THEN
    PRINT "Valid email."
ELSE
    PRINT "Invalid email. '@' is missing."
END IF
```

**Output (if the user enters "userexample.com"):**
```
Invalid email. '@' is missing.
```

---

### **26.5.4 Counting Occurrences of a Substring**
Use `INSTR` in a loop to count how many times a substring appears in a string.

#### **Example**
```basic
DIM text AS STRING
DIM count AS INTEGER
DIM position AS INTEGER

text = "banana"
count = 0
position = 0

DO
    position = INSTR(position + 1, text, "a")
    IF position > 0 THEN
        count = count + 1
    END IF
LOOP UNTIL position = 0

PRINT "The letter 'a' appears "; count; " times."
```

**Output:**
```
The letter 'a' appears 3 times.
```

---

## **26.6 Common Errors with `INSTR`**

1. **Invalid Starting Position:**
   - Ensure the `start` position is within the valid range of the string.
   ```basic
   PRINT INSTR(50, "Hello", "o")  ' Error: Starting position exceeds string length
   ```

2. **Empty Strings:**
   - Using an empty string as the `substring` always returns `0`.

3. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - `INSTR` is case-sensitive by default. Use `UCASE$` or `LCASE$` for case-insensitive searches.

---

## **26.7 Best Practices for Using `INSTR`**

1. **Check for `0`:**
   - Always check the return value to ensure the substring exists.
   ```basic
   IF INSTR(text, "keyword") > 0 THEN ...
   ```

2. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - Account for empty strings and substrings not found in the string.

3. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Name variables clearly to indicate their purpose.
   ```basic
   DIM startPosition AS INTEGER
   ```

4. **Normalize Cases for Comparisons:**
   - Use `UCASE$` or `LCASE$` to avoid issues with case sensitivity.

## **26.8 Summary**
The `INSTR` function is a versatile tool for searching within strings in QBasic. By returning the position of a substring, it enables tasks like keyword searches, substring extraction, and input validation. Combining `INSTR` with other string functions such as `MID$`, `UCASE$`, and `LEN` further enhances its capabilities. Understanding and mastering `INSTR` is essential for effective string manipulation in your programs.
