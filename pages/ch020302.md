# Arithmetic Operations (Addition, Subtraction, etc.)

## **10.1 Introduction**
Arithmetic operations are the foundation of mathematical calculations in programming. In QBasic, you can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder). These operations allow you to manipulate numeric data and create powerful programs.

This chapter explains each arithmetic operation, their syntax, and examples to help you understand how to use them in QBasic.

## **10.2 List of Arithmetic Operators**
QBasic supports the following arithmetic operators:

| **Operator** | **Operation**           | **Symbol** | **Example**           | **Result**  |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Addition     | Adds two numbers         | `+`        | `5 + 3`               | `8`         |
| Subtraction  | Subtracts one number from another | `-` | `8 - 3`               | `5`         |
| Multiplication | Multiplies two numbers | `*`        | `4 * 2`               | `8`         |
| Division     | Divides one number by another | `/`   | `10 / 2`              | `5`         |
| Modulus      | Finds the remainder of division | `MOD` | `10 MOD 3`            | `1`         |
| Exponentiation | Raises a number to a power | `^`    | `2 ^ 3`               | `8`         |

## **10.3 Performing Arithmetic Operations**

### **10.3.1 Addition**
The `+` operator adds two or more numbers together.

#### Example:
```basic
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER
DIM sum AS INTEGER

num1 = 15
num2 = 10
sum = num1 + num2

PRINT "The sum of "; num1; " and "; num2; " is "; sum
```

**Output:**
```
The sum of 15 and 10 is 25
```

---

### **10.3.2 Subtraction**
The `-` operator subtracts one number from another.

#### Example:
```basic
DIM a AS INTEGER
DIM b AS INTEGER
DIM result AS INTEGER

a = 20
b = 5
result = a - b

PRINT "The difference is "; result
```

**Output:**
```
The difference is 15
```

---

### **10.3.3 Multiplication**
The `*` operator multiplies two numbers.

#### Example:
```basic
DIM length AS INTEGER
DIM width AS INTEGER
DIM area AS INTEGER

length = 10
width = 5
area = length * width

PRINT "The area of the rectangle is "; area
```

**Output:**
```
The area of the rectangle is 50
```

---

### **10.3.4 Division**
The `/` operator divides one number by another.

#### Example:
```basic
DIM total AS INTEGER
DIM num AS INTEGER
DIM average AS SINGLE

total = 50
num = 5
average = total / num

PRINT "The average is "; average
```

**Output:**
```
The average is 10
```

---

### **10.3.5 Modulus**
The `MOD` operator finds the remainder of a division.

#### Example:
```basic
DIM dividend AS INTEGER
DIM divisor AS INTEGER
DIM remainder AS INTEGER

dividend = 10
divisor = 3
remainder = dividend MOD divisor

PRINT "The remainder is "; remainder
```

**Output:**
```
The remainder is 1
```

---

### **10.3.6 Exponentiation**
The `^` operator raises a number to a power.

#### Example:
```basic
DIM base AS INTEGER
DIM exponent AS INTEGER
DIM power AS INTEGER

base = 2
exponent = 3
power = base ^ exponent

PRINT base; " raised to the power of "; exponent; " is "; power
```

**Output:**
```
2 raised to the power of 3 is 8
```

---

## **10.4 Combining Multiple Operations**
You can combine multiple arithmetic operations in a single expression. Use parentheses to control the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

### **Example: Combining Operations**
```basic
DIM result AS SINGLE

result = (5 + 3) * 2 - 4 / 2
PRINT "The result is "; result
```

**Output:**
```
The result is 14
```

---

## **10.5 Using Variables in Operations**
You can store numeric values in variables and perform arithmetic operations using these variables.

### **Example: Using Variables**
```basic
DIM num1 AS INTEGER
DIM num2 AS INTEGER
DIM total AS INTEGER

num1 = 12
num2 = 8
total = num1 + num2 * 2

PRINT "The total is "; total
```

**Output:**
```
The total is 28
```

---

## **10.6 Handling Division by Zero**
In QBasic, dividing a number by zero causes an error. Always validate your divisor to avoid this.

### **Example: Preventing Division by Zero**
```basic
DIM num AS INTEGER
DIM divisor AS INTEGER

num = 10
INPUT "Enter divisor: ", divisor

IF divisor = 0 THEN
    PRINT "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
ELSE
    PRINT "Result: "; num / divisor
END IF
```

**Output (if user enters `0`):**
```
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
```

## **10.7 Common Errors in Arithmetic Operations**
1. **Mismatched Data Types:**
   - Assigning a floating-point result to an integer variable truncates the decimal part.
   - Example:
     ```basic
     DIM result AS INTEGER
     result = 5 / 2   ' Result will be 2, not 2.5
     ```

2. **Division by Zero:**
   - Causes runtime errors; handle using conditional checks.

3. **Incorrect Operator Precedence:**
   - Always use parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.

---

## **10.8 Best Practices for Arithmetic Operations**
1. **Use Meaningful Variable Names:**
   - Example: Use `radius` instead of `r` for clarity.
2. **Check for Zero in Division:**
   - Validate divisors before performing division.
3. **Parentheses for Clarity:**
   - Use parentheses to make expressions easier to read and debug.
4. **Comment Your Code:**
   - Explain complex expressions using comments.

---

## **10.9 Summary**
Arithmetic operations are the backbone of programming calculations. In QBasic, you can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. Combining these operations allows you to write powerful and efficient programs. Remember to validate input, use parentheses for clarity, and choose appropriate data types for your variables.
